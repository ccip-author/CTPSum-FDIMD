The results revealed that the scores of patients wearing braces were significantly lower than those of patients without braces -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- . TUG -LRB- p = 0.01 -RRB- , fall risk index -LRB- p = 0.002 -RRB- , anterior/posterior index -LRB- p = 0.01 -RRB- , medial/lateral index -LRB- p = 0.04 -RRB- , overall stability index -LRB- p = 0.01 -RRB- and Berg balance scale -LRB- p = 0.04 -RRB- were significantly improved after the training in the intervention group , but had no significant differences in the control group . The changes in TUG -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- and fall risk index -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group ."}
