{"label": "negative", "sentence": "Plain abdominal radiography is currently the modality of choice for initial evaluation of gastrointestinal tract in neonates . When controlling for birth weight and gestational age , the congenital heart disease group had decreased risk of perforation , need for a bowel operation , strictures , need for a stoma , sepsis , and short bowel syndrome compared with the non-congenital heart disease group . Demographic , preoperative , and operative variables were recorded retrospectively in 21 neonates with congenital heart disease who developed NEC and 70 control neonates matched by diagnosis and age at admission . To test the hypothesis that congenital heart disease -LRB- CHD -RRB- in preterm infants with severe CHD -LRB- cyanotic or left-sided obstructive lesions , or congestive heart failure -RRB- is independently associated with necrotizing enterocolitis -LRB- NEC , stage II or greater -RRB- ."}
{"label": "positive", "sentence": "No significant differences were found between IMR and problem-solving groups . Participants in both groups improved significantly over time in symptom severity , illness management , and quality of life and had fewer emergency department visits . The scale successfully differentiated between IMR and control groups . Compared to staff who had no recovery-related training in the past year , staff who had at least one recovery-related training reported significantly higher consumer optimism and a greater agency recovery orientation towards consumers ' life goals ."}
{"label": "negative", "sentence": "When averaged over the whole brain , the subject-wise correlation between the motor and BH tasks showed a similar linear relationship within the group . Likewise , a significant linear correlation was observed between motor-task activity and RSFA across voxels and subjects . We propose that T-fMRI responses are reliably predictable to the voxel level in situations where only R-fMRI measures are possible , and may be useful for assessing neural activity in task non-compliant clinical populations . We also take a more speculative look forward to the emerging development of strategies for combining transcranial magnetic stimulation with other brain imaging technologies and methods in the cognitive neurosciences ."}
{"label": "positive", "sentence": "The results showed that the patients with OA in each treated group had significant improvement in pain reduction , disability reduction , and in walking speed after treatment and at follow-up when compared with their initial status . The results revealed that the scores of patients wearing braces were significantly lower than those of patients without braces -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- . TUG -LRB- p = 0.01 -RRB- , fall risk index -LRB- p = 0.002 -RRB- , anterior/posterior index -LRB- p = 0.01 -RRB- , medial/lateral index -LRB- p = 0.04 -RRB- , overall stability index -LRB- p = 0.01 -RRB- and Berg balance scale -LRB- p = 0.04 -RRB- were significantly improved after the training in the intervention group , but had no significant differences in the control group . The changes in TUG -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- and fall risk index -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group ."}
