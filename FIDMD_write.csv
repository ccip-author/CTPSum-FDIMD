6	negative	conflict	5-year LPFS 	A moderate dose of radiation is the recommended treatment for solitary plasmacytoma -LRB- SP -RRB- , but there is controversy over the role of surgery . Our study aimed at comparing different treatment modalities in the management of SP. . Data from 38 consecutive patients with solitary plasmacytoma , including 16 with bone plasmacytoma and 22 with extramedullary plasmacytoma , were retrospectively reviewed . 15 patients received radiotherapy alone ; 11 received surgery alone , and 12 received both . The median radiation dose was 50Gy . All operations were performed as radical resections . Local progression-free survival -LRB- LPFS -RRB- , multiple myeloma-free survival -LRB- MMFS -RRB- , progression-free survival -LRB- PFS -RRB- and overall survival -LRB- OS -RRB- were calculated and outcomes of different therapies were compared . The median follow-up time was 55 months . 5-year LPFS , MMFS , PFS and OS were 87.0 % , 80.9 % , 69.8 % and 87.4 % , respectively . Univariate analysis revealed , compared with surgery alone , radiotherapy alone was associated with significantly higher 5-year LPFS -LRB- 100 % vs 69.3 % , p = 0.016 -RRB- , MMFS -LRB- 100 % vs 51.4 % , p = 0.006 -RRB- , PFS -LRB- 100 % vs 33.7 % , p = 0.0004 -RRB- and OS -LRB- 100 % vs 70 % , p = 0.041 -RRB- . Radiotherapy alone can be considered as a more effective treatment for SP over surgery . Whether a combination of radiotherapy and surgery improves outcomes requires further study . To assess the outcomes and patterns of failure in solitary plasmacytoma -LRB- SP -RRB- . The data from 258 patients with bone -LRB- n = 206 -RRB- or extramedullary -LRB- n = 52 -RRB- SP without evidence of multiple myeloma -LRB- MM -RRB- were collected . A histopathologic diagnosis was obtained for all patients . The median radiation dose was 40 Gy . The median follow-up was 56 months -LRB- range 7-245 -RRB- . The median time to MM development was 21 months -LRB- range 2-135 -RRB- , with a 5-year probability of 45 % . The 5-year overall survival , disease-free survival , and local control rate was 74 % , 50 % , and 86 % , respectively . On multivariate analyses , the favorable factors were younger age and tumor size < 4 cm for survival ; younger age , extramedullary localization , and RT for disease-free survival ; and small tumor and RT for local control . Bone localization was the only predictor of MM development . Progression to MM remains the main problem . Patients with extramedullary SP had the best outcomes , especially when treated with moderate-dose RT. . Chemotherapy and/or novel therapies should be investigated for bone or bulky extramedullary SP. . The Cyberknife delivers frameless image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery to intracranial and extracranial tumors . We report our use of Cyberknife radiosurgery on a medullary plasmacytoma in the clivus extending into the foramen magnum . No acute toxicity was seen during or within 24 hours of treatment , and the subject had a complete and durable radiographic response on MRI 12 + months after treatment . To our knowledge , this is a first case of successful Cyberknife radiosurgery of a medullary plasmacytoma .

10	negative	conflict	At 6 months 	The purpose of the Correction of Myopia Evaluation Trial -LRB- COMET -RRB- was to evaluate the effect of progressive addition lenses -LRB- PALs -RRB- compared with single vision lenses -LRB- SVLs -RRB- on the progression of juvenile-onset myopia . COMET enrolled 469 children -LRB- ages 6-11 years -RRB- with myopia between -1.25 and -4.50 D spherical equivalent . The children were recruited at four colleges of optometry in the United States and were ethnically diverse . They were randomly assigned to receive either PALs with a +2.00 addition -LRB- n = 235 -RRB- or SVLs -LRB- n = 234 -RRB- , the conventional spectacle treatment for myopia , and were followed for 3 years . The primary outcome measure was progression of myopia , as determined by autorefraction after cycloplegia with 2 drops of 1 % tropicamide at each annual visit . The secondary outcome measure was change in axial length of the eyes , as assessed by A-scan ultrasonography . Child-based analyses -LRB- i.e. , the mean of the two eyes -RRB- were used . Results were adjusted for important covariates , by using multiple linear regression . Of the 469 children -LRB- mean age at baseline , 9.3 + / - 1.3 years -RRB- , 462 -LRB- 98.5 % -RRB- completed the 3-year visit . Mean -LRB- + / - SE -RRB- 3-year increases in myopia -LRB- spherical equivalent -RRB- were -1.28 + / - 0.06 D in the PAL group and -1.48 + / - 0.06 D in the SVL group . The 3-year difference in progression of 0.20 + / - 0.08 D between the two groups was statistically significant -LRB- P = 0.004 -RRB- . At 6 months , 17 % of the PAL group versus 30 % of the SVL group needed a prescription change -LRB- P = 0.0007 -RRB- , and , at 1 year , 43 % of the PAL group versus 59 % of the SVL group required a prescription change -LRB- P = 0.002 -RRB- . Interaction analyses identified a significantly larger treatment effect of PALs in children with lower versus higher baseline accommodative response at near -LRB- P = 0.03 -RRB- and with lower versus higher baseline myopia -LRB- P = 0.04 -RRB- . Mean -LRB- + / - SE -RRB- increases in the axial length of eyes of children in the PAL and SVL groups , respectively , were : 0.64 + / - 0.02 mm and 0.75 + / - 0.02 mm , with a statistically significant 3-year mean difference of 0.11 + / - 0.03 mm -LRB- P = 0.0002 -RRB- . Mean changes in axial length correlated with those in refractive error -LRB- r = 0.86 for PAL and 0.89 for SVL -RRB- . Use of PALs compared with SVLs slowed the progression of myopia in COMET children by a small , statistically significant amount only during the first year . The size of the treatment effect remained similar and significant for the next 2 years . The results provide some support for the COMET rationale-that is , a role for defocus in progression of myopia . The small magnitude of the effect does not warrant a change in clinical practice . To examine associations between myopia and measures of urbanization in a population-based sample of 12-year-old Australian children . Questionnaire data on sociodemographic and environmental factors including ethnicity , parental education , and time spent in near work and outdoor activities were collected from 2367 children -LRB- 75.0 % response -RRB- and their parents . Population density data for the Sydney area were used to construct five urban regions . Myopia was defined as spherical equivalent refraction < / = -0.50 D. Myopia prevalence was lowest in the outer suburban region -LRB- 6.9 % -RRB- and highest in the inner city region -LRB- 17.8 % -RRB- , with mean refraction tending toward greater myopia by region -LRB- outer suburban to inner city -RRB- , after adjustment for age , sex , ethnicity , near work , outdoor activity , and parental myopia . Multivariate-adjusted analyses confirmed greater odds for myopia in regions of higher population density -LRB- P -LRB- trend -RRB- = 0.0001 -RRB- . Myopia was significantly more prevalent among children living in apartment residences than other housing types -LRB- chi -LRB- 2 -RRB- < 0.0001 -RRB- , after adjustment for ethnicity , near work , and outdoor activity . Housing density -LRB- measured as the number of houses visible from a front door -RRB- was not significantly associated with myopia -LRB- chi -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 0.1 -RRB- . For both European Caucasian and East Asian children , myopia was most prevalent in the inner city region -LRB- 8.1 % and 55.1 % , for European Caucasian and East Asian , respectively -RRB- . The higher myopia prevalence in inner city-urban areas compared with outer suburban areas for this large childhood sample suggest that even moderate environmental differences within a predominantly urban setting may be associated with increased odds of myopia . These findings are consistent with previous reports of rural-urban differences in childhood myopia . To estimate the societal economic burden and the governmental budgetary impact of the following visual disorders among US adults aged 40 years and older : visual impairment , blindness , refractive error , age-related macular degeneration , cataracts , diabetic retinopathy , and primary open-angle glaucoma . We estimated 3 components of economic burden : direct medical costs , other direct costs , and productivity losses . We used private insurance and Medicare claims data to estimate direct medical costs ; epidemiologic evidence from multiple published sources to estimate other direct costs , such as nursing home costs ; and data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to estimate productivity losses . We used budgetary documents and our direct medical and other direct cost estimates to approximate the governmental budgetary impact . We estimated that the annual total financial burden of major adult visual disorders is $ 35.4 billion -LRB- $ 16.2 billion in direct medical costs , $ 11.1 billion in other direct costs , and $ 8 billion in productivity losses -RRB- and that the annual governmental budgetary impact is $ 13.7 billion . Major visual disorders among Americans older than 40 years result in substantial economic costs for the US economy . Well-designed public health programs may have the ability to reduce this burden in the future . Besides the direct economic and social burden of myopia , associated ocular complications may lead to substantial visual loss . In several population and clinic-based cohorts , case-control and cross-sectional studies , higher risks of posterior subcapsular cataract , cortical and nuclear cataract in myopic patients were reported . Patients with high myopia -LRB- spherical equivalent at least -6.0 D -RRB- are more susceptible to ocular abnormalities . The prevalent risks of glaucoma were higher in myopic adults , and risks of chorioretinal abnormalities such as retinal detachment , chorioretinal atrophy and lacquer cracks increased with severity of myopia and greater axial length . Myopic adults were more likely to have tilted , rotated , and larger discs as well as other optic disc abnormalities . Often , these studies support possible associations between myopia and specific ocular complications , but we can not infer causality because of limitations in study methodology . The detection and treatment of possible pathological ocular complications is essential in the management of high myopia . The ocular risks associated with myopia should not be underestimated and there is a public health need to prevent the onset or progression of myopia . To compare US population prevalence estimates for myopia in 1971-1972 and 1999-2004 . The 1971-1972 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided the earliest nationally representative estimates for US myopia prevalence ; myopia was diagnosed by an algorithm using either lensometry , pinhole visual acuity , and presenting visual acuity -LRB- for presenting visual acuity > or = 20/40 -RRB- or retinoscopy -LRB- for presenting visual acuity < or = 20/50 -RRB- . Using a similar method for diagnosing myopia , we examined data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to determine whether myopia prevalence had changed during the 30 years between the 2 surveys . Using the 1971-1972 method , the estimated prevalence of myopia in persons aged 12 to 54 years was significantly higher in 1999-2004 than in 1971-1972 -LRB- 41.6 % vs 25.0 % , respectively ; P < .001 -RRB- . Prevalence estimates were higher in 1999-2004 than in 1971-1972 for black individuals -LRB- 33.5 % vs 13.0 % , respectively ; P < .001 -RRB- and white individuals -LRB- 43.0 % vs 26.3 % , respectively ; P < .001 -RRB- and for all levels of myopia severity -LRB- > -2.0 diopters -LSB- D -RSB- : 17.5 % vs 13.4 % , respectively -LSB- P < .001 -RSB- ; < or = -2.0 to > -7.9 D : 22.4 % vs 11.4 % , respectively -LSB- P < .001 -RSB- ; < or = -7.9 D : 1.6 % vs 0.2 % , respectively -LSB- P < .001 -RSB- -RRB- . When using similar methods for each period , the prevalence of myopia in the United States appears to be substantially higher in 1999-2004 than 30 years earlier . Identifying modifiable risk factors for myopia could lead to the development of cost-effective interventional strategies .
11	negative	conflict	There was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in right atrial pressure -LRB- 9.2 + / - 3.9 vs. 11.2 + / - 4.1 	The role of nesiritide in pediatric heart failure has not been examined . In the present study , we reviewed our initial experience with nesiritide in children with primary heart failure or low cardiac output after heart surgery . Nesiritide was administered in an open-label fashion to patients with heart failure who were already receiving inotropic and diuretic therapy . Between July 2003 and August 2004 , 30 patients aged 5 days to 16.7 yrs -LRB- median age , 4.6 months -RRB- received nesiritide therapy . Diagnoses included single-ventricle congenital defect -LRB- n = 5 -RRB- , two-ventricle congenital defect -LRB- n = 13 -RRB- , heart transplant -LRB- n = 5 -RRB- , and dilated cardiomyopathy -LRB- n = 7 -RRB- . Sixteen patients were started on nesiritide within 2 wks of corrective or palliative heart surgery . The majority of subjects -LRB- n = 24 -RRB- received an initial bolus dose . Continuous infusion dosage ranged between 0.005 and 0.02 microg.kg.min . Duration of therapy ranged from 1 to 24 days -LRB- median , 4 days -RRB- . Administration of nesiritide was associated with improvement in fluid balance from positive 0.8 + / - 1.9 mL.kg.hr at baseline to negative 0.3 + / - 1.8 mL.kg.hr after 24 hrs of therapy -LRB- p = .02 -RRB- . There was a nonsignificant trend toward a reduction in right atrial pressure -LRB- 9.2 + / - 3.9 vs. 11.2 + / - 4.1 , p = .08 -RRB- . We report the use of nesiritide in two infants following cardiac surgery . Both infants had increased intracardiac filling pressures postoperatively , despite traditional afterload reduction and diuretics . Both infants demonstrated clinical improvement with nesiritide therapy . There is currently limited data available describing the use of nesiritide in infants .

22	negative	conflict	The sensitivity 	OBJECTIVE . Endoscopic ultrasonography -LRB- EUS -RRB- - guided fine-needle aspiration -LRB- EUS-FNA -RRB- may facilitate tissue sampling for histopathological diagnosis of subepithelial tumors -LRB- SETs -RRB- in the gastrointestinal -LRB- GI -RRB- tract . However , immunohistochemistry is not always feasible using EUS-FNA samples due to the low quality of specimens often obtained by aspiration . This study aimed to compare the use of 22-gauge -LRB- G -RRB- EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy -LRB- EUS-FNB -RRB- with 22G EUS-FNA for core sampling used for histopathological examination , including immunohistochemistry , in patients with GI SETs . METHODS . Twenty-eight patients with GI SETs ≥ 2 cm in size were prospectively enrolled at five university hospitals in Korea between January and June 2013 . They were randomized to undergo either EUS-FNB or EUS-FNA . RESULTS . A total of 22 patients was finally analyzed in this study : 10 and 12 patients underwent EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB , respectively . Compared to the EUS-FNA group , the EUS-FNB group had a significantly lower median number of needle passes to obtain macroscopically optimal core samples -LRB- 4 vs. 2 , p = 0.025 -RRB- ; higher yield rates of macroscopically and histologically optimal core samples with three needle passes -LRB- 30 % vs. 92 % , p = 0.006 ; 20 % vs. 75 % , p = 0.010 , respectively -RRB- ; and a higher diagnostic sufficiency rate -LRB- 20 % vs. 75 % , p = 0.010 -RRB- . No technical difficulties were encountered in either group . CONCLUSIONS . This study shows that EUS-FNB has a better ability to obtain histological core samples and a higher diagnostic sufficiency rate than EUS-FNA and that EUS-FNB is a feasible , safe , and preferable modality for adequate core sampling for histopathological diagnosis of GI SETs . Endoscopic ultrasound -LRB- EUS -RRB- with fine needle aspiration -LRB- FNA -RRB- is a safe and effective way to sample lesions in the gastrointestinal tract . Rapid on-site specimen evaluation -LRB- ROSE -RRB- improves the accuracy of EUS-FNA . While data suggests that EUS with fine-needle biopsy -LRB- EUS-FNB -RRB- is effective , it remains unclear if ROSE is predictive of a final diagnosis when obtaining core specimens . The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of ROSE in achieving a final diagnosis for EUS-FNB core specimens . We evaluated 60 consecutive patients referred for EUS guided sampling of lesions within or adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract . All patients underwent EUS-FNB to evaluate the additive value of ROSE to the diagnostic accuracy of specimens obtained using a core biopsy needle . EUS-FNA was also performed in a majority of cases . EUS-FNB was feasible in all 60 cases ; on-site specimen adequacy and final diagnostic accuracy was 58 % -LSB- 95 % confidence intervals -LRB- CI -RRB- 45.1-71.2 -RSB- and 83 % -LRB- 95 % CI 71.9-91.5 -RRB- , respectively . The sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value -LRB- PPV -RRB- , and negative predictive value of ROSE for core biopsies were 65 , 100 , 100 , and 39 % , respectively . On-site adequacy and diagnostic accuracy for EUS-FNA was 38 % -LRB- 95 % CI 22.2-53.5 -RRB- and 63 % -LRB- 95 % CI 50.1-75.8 -RRB- , respectively . There were no significant complications . EUS-FNB is safe , feasible , and effective . ROSE of the core biopsy provides excellent PPV ; however , an inadequate ROSE appears to be of limited value . Further prospective studies are needed to assess the optimal handling and onsite processing of core specimens to determine whether ROSE is beneficial for EUS-FNB . Retrospective cohort study of subjects who underwent EUS sampling of nonpancreatic adenocarcinoma lesions between February 2011 and May 2013 . Over the study period , there were 43 lesions biopsied in 41 unique patients in the EUS-FNB group and 53 patients in the EUS-FNA/B group . Overall diagnostic accuracy was similar between the EUS-FNB and EUS-FNA/B groups -LRB- 83.7 % vs. 84.9 % ; p = 1.0 -RRB- . In the subgroup of subepithelial mass lesions , diagnostic accuracy remained similar in the EUS-FNB and EUS-FNA/B groups -LRB- 81.0 % and 70.6 % ; p = 0.7 -RRB- . EUS-FNB procedures were significantly shorter than those in the EUS-FNA/B group -LRB- 58.4 minutes vs. 73.5 minutes ; p < 0.0001 -RRB- . EUS-FNB without on-site cytology provides a high diagnostic accuracy in nonpancreas adenocarcinoma lesions . There appears to be no additive benefit with initial EUS-FNA but this requires further study in a prospective study . Current limitations of EUS-guided FNA include the need for multiple passes and on-site cytology assessment and lack of core specimen . Recently , a new 25-gauge core biopsy needle -LRB- PC25 -RRB- was developed to overcome these limitations . To determine the diagnostic yield of EUS-guided FNA aspiration biopsy -LRB- FNAB -RRB- when using the PC25 needle among patients with solid pancreatic lesions . Retrospective analysis . Academic tertiary referral center . Fifty consecutive patients with a solid pancreatic lesion underwent EUS-guided FNAB with PC25 . EUS-guided FNAB with PC25 . The primary outcome was the diagnostic yield in single and overall passes of EUS-guided FNAB when using the PC25 needle for pancreatic solid lesions . Cytologic analysis showed malignancy in 38 patients on the first pass , with a cumulative sensitivity of 83 % , 91 % , and 96 % on passes 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . Although visible core was reported in 46 patients -LRB- 92 % -RRB- , histologic core was seen in 16 patients -LRB- 32 % -RRB- . Histologic analysis showed malignancy in 29 patients on the first pass , with a cumulative sensitivity of 63 % and 87 % on pass 1 and passes 1 to 4 , respectively . The sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy in combined cytologic and histologic results were 85 % , 100 % , and 86 % for single pass and 96 % , 100 % , and 96 % on multiple passes , respectively . No complications were seen . A retrospective study design at a single center using a single arm . EUS-guided FNAB with the PC25 needle showed excellent single-pass and overall diagnostic yields . This needle appears to maintain a high cytologic yield , similar to standard 25-gauge FNA needles , while also providing some histologic core tissue . Contemporary EUS-guided FNA techniques involve the use of a needle , with an air column within the lumen , with or without suction . We describe a novel technique with an aim to improve the quality of the aspirate . To compare a novel `` wet suction '' technique -LRB- WEST -RRB- with the conventional FNA technique -LRB- CFNAT -RRB- of EUS-guided FNA using a 22-gauge FNA needle . Two large tertiary-care hospitals . All consecutive adult patients presenting for EUS with possible FNA of solid lesions were offered the chance to participate in the study . All lesions were sampled with the same needle by using alternating techniques . Patients were randomized to the WEST versus the CFNAT for the first pass . If the first pass was made with the WEST , the second pass was made with the CFNAT , and subsequent passes were made in an alternating manner by using the same sequence . All FNAs were performed using 22-gauge needles . Specimen adequacy , cellularity , and blood contamination of EUS-guided FNA aspirates graded on a predefined scale . The WEST yielded significantly higher cellularity in a cell block compared with the CFNAT , with a mean cellularity score of 1.82 ± 0.76 versus 1.45 ± 0.768 -LRB- P < .0003 -RRB- . The WEST cell block resulted in a significantly better specimen adequacy of 85.5 % versus 75.2 % -LRB- P < .035 -RRB- . There was no difference in the amount of blood contamination between the 2 techniques . Lack of cross check and grading by a second cytopathologist .

Subjects included 12 males and 11 females , ages 9-38 years -LRB- mean , 19.7 + / - 1.8 years -RRB- . Initial dosage of cyclosporine was 10 mg/kg/day , given as a single daily dose , adjusted on the basis of side effects and trough cyclosporine levels . Glycemic control and insulin dosage were similar in both cyclosporine and placebo groups . The frequency of freedom from insulin usage also was similar in both groups ; however , it is not possible to draw conclusions about response rates , because of the very small sample size . Glucose tolerance , as measured by rate of intravenous glucose disposal did not differ between groups . Moreover , acute insulin response to intravenous glucose was not restored in any subject . On the other hand , in comparison to the placebo group , the cyclosporine group did show an increased meal-stimulated C-peptide response after 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months . When measured by regression analysis , the slope defining the rate of decline of beta cell function was significantly slower for the cyclosporine group than the placebo group -LRB- p less than 0.05 -RRB- . Thus , as measured in response to a physiological stimulus -LRB- meal challenge -RRB- , cyclosporine preserves islet beta cell function when used in recent onset type I diabetes . Side effects were minimal and reversible upon cessation of immune intervention . The preservation of islet beta cell function by immune intervention is consistent with the hypothesis that type I diabetes has an immune mechanism involved in its pathogenesis .

46	negative	conflict	1 factor 	Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma -LRB- AITL -RRB- is a systemic disease involving lymph nodes , spleen , and bone marrow . Although the histologic features have been well described , the diagnosis is often challenging , as there are no specific phenotypic or molecular markers available . This study shows that the neoplastic cells of AITL can be identified by aberrant CD10 expression . Archival material from 30 cases of AITL , 10 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified -LRB- PTL -RRB- , and 10 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia were reviewed . Single and double immunostaining for CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD20 , CD21 , CD10 , BCL6 , Ki67 , and LMP-1 in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr early region and polymerase chain reaction -LRB- PCR -RRB- for T-cell receptor gamma chain gene and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene were performed . Three overlapping histologic patterns with hyperplastic follicles , depleted follicles , or without follicles were identified in AITL . Of the 30 cases of AITL , 27 contained CD10 -LRB- + -RRB- T cells . No CD10 -LRB- + -RRB- T cells were present in the cases of PTL or reactive hyperplasia . PCR confirmed a monoclonal or oligoclonal T-cell population in 29 of 30 cases of AITL and a monoclonal B-cell population in 6 cases . Analysis of microdissected CD10 -LRB- + -RRB- single cells showed that they belonged to the neoplastic clone . In conclusion CD10 is a phenotypic marker that specifically identifies the tumor cells in 90 % of AITL , including the early cases . The presence of these cells distinguishes AITL from other PTLs . This finding provides an objective criterion for accurate and early diagnosis of AITL . Various patterns of Epstein-Barr virus -LRB- EBV -RRB- - associated B-cell lymphoproliferation occur in patients with immunodeficiency . We studied 17 cases of T-cell lymphoma displaying extensive EBV-driven B-cell lymphoproliferation or simultaneous/subsequent EBV-associated B-cell lymphoma . In 10 cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma , an uncommonly prominent population of EBV + atypical , activated , focally confluent large transformed B cells was found in the background of T-cell lymphoma . In 4 cases , an EBV-associated B-cell neoplasm -LRB- 3 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas , 1 plasmacytoma -RRB- occurred in patients with T-cell lymphoma . Three cases were composite lymphomas of a peripheral T-cell lymphoma , unspecified , combined with EBV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . The transformed B-cell population displayed EBV latency types 2 and 3 . Monoclonal and oligoclonal B-cell populations were detected in 5 and 6 cases , respectively . Peripheral T-cell lymphomas -LRB- PTCL -RRB- have been generally reported to have a worse prognosis than B-cell lymphomas -LRB- BCL -RRB- . Because of their heterogeneity and scarcity , the outcomes of the different histological subtypes have not been compared . From October 1987 to March 1993 , 1,883 patients with diffuse aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas -LRB- NHL -RRB- included in the LNH87 protocol could be assessed for both morphology and immunophenotyping . Among them , 288 -LRB- 15 % -RRB- had PTCL and 1,595 -LRB- 85 % -RRB- had BCL . According to the Kiel classification , most PTCL were classified as angioimmunoblastic -LRB- AIL ; 23 % -RRB- , pleomorphic medium and large T-cell -LRB- PML ; 49 % -RRB- , or anaplastic large cell -LRB- ALCL ; 20 % -RRB- lymphomas . According to the International Prognostic Index -LRB- IPI -RRB- , PTCL and BCL scores were , respectively : 0 factors , 13 % and 15 % ; 1 factor , 17 % and 22 % ; 2 factors , 24 % and 25 % ; > / = 3 factors , 45 % and 37 % -LRB- P = .09 -RRB- . For BCL and PTCL , respectively , complete remission rates were 63 % and 54 % -LRB- P = .004 -RRB- ; the 5-year overall survival -LRB- OS -RRB- rates were 53 % and 41 % -LRB- P = .0004 -RRB- and event-free survival -LRB- EFS -RRB- rates were 42 % and 33 % -LRB- P < . 0001 -RRB- . Comparison of the different histological subtypes of lymphoma showed that the 5-year OS rate for T-ALCL -LRB- 64 % -RRB- was superior to those of other PTCL -LRB- 35 % -RRB- as well as diffuse large B-cell -LRB- 53 % -RRB- NHL . When multivariate analysis was applied using the IPI score as one factor , nonanaplastic PTCL remained an independent parameter -LRB- P = . 0004 -RRB- . Although the poor prognosis of non-ALCL PTCL could be due in part to the presence of adverse prognostic factors at diagnosis , this study shows that the T-cell phenotype is an independent significant factor , which should be incorporated into the definition of prognostic groups .
47	negative		 a less costly and less nursing-intensive therapy than 3 days of IV insulin postoperatively 	To describe a novel method of safe and effective intensive management of inpatient hyperglycemia with use of cost-effective protocols directed by a glucose management service -LRB- GMS -RRB- . An intravenous insulin protocol was designed to achieve a glycemic target of 80 to 110 mg/dL . When stable inpatients were transferred from the intravenous protocol to a subcutaneous insulin protocol , which consisted of basal long-acting and prandial and supplemental rapid-acting insulins , the blood glucose target was 80 to 150 mg/dL . Glucose levels were reviewed by the GMS at least daily for protocol adjustments , when necessary . The intravenous insulin protocol was used in 276 patients , and 4,058 capillary blood glucose levels were recorded . Glycemic target levels -LRB- 80 to 110 mg/dL -RRB- were achieved , on average , 10.6 + / - 5.2 hours after initiation of insulin drip therapy . The mean capillary blood glucose level during the study interval was 135.3 + / - 49.9 mg/dL . Hypoglycemia -LRB- < or = 60 mg/dL -RRB- was recorded in 1.5 % of glucose values , and hyperglycemia -LRB- > or = 400 mg/dL -RRB- was recorded in only 0.06 % . The subcutaneous insulin protocol was used in 922 patients , and 18,067 capillary glucose levels were documented . The mean blood glucose level was 145.6 + / - 55.8 mg/dL during the study period . The blood glucose target of 80 to 150 mg/dL was achieved in 58.6 % , whereas 74.3 % of glycemic values were in the clinically acceptable range -LRB- 80 to 180 mg/dL -RRB- . Hypoglycemia -LRB- < or = 60 mg/dL -RRB- occurred in 1.3 % of capillary blood glucose values , and hyperglycemia -LRB- > or = 400 mg/dL -RRB- occurred in 0.4 % of values . Validated protocols dedicated to the achievement of strict glycemic goals were implemented by a GMS and resulted in substantial improvements in glycemic control on the surgical inpatient services , with a reduced frequency of hypoglycemia . The protocols and the GMS have been well received by the inpatient nursing and surgical staff members , and all of this has been done in a cost-effective manner . To determine if glucose management in postcardiothoracic surgery patients with a combined intravenous -LRB- IV -RRB- and subcutaneous -LRB- SC -RRB- insulin regimen reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with diabetes and stress-induced hyperglycemia . Retrospective review of 614 consecutive patients who underwent cardiothoracic -LRB- CT -RRB- surgery in 2005 was performed to evaluate the incidence and treatment of postoperative hyperglycemia and operative morbidity and mortality . Hyperglycemic patients -LRB- glucose > 6.05 mmol/l -RRB- were treated with IV insulin in the intensive care unit -LRB- ICU -RRB- followed by SC insulin -LRB- outside ICU -RRB- . Subgroup analysis was performed on 159 coronary artery bypass grafting -LRB- CABG -RRB- - only patients . Among all CT surgeries , patients with a preoperative diagnosis of diabetes had higher rates of postoperative mortality -LRB- 7.3 vs. 3.3 % ; P = 0.03 -RRB- and pulmonary complications -LRB- 19.5 vs. 11.6 % ; P = 0.02 -RRB- but had similar rates of infections and cardiac , renal , and neurological complications on univariate analysis . However , on multivariate analysis , a preoperative diagnosis of diabetes was not a significant factor in postoperative mortality or pulmonary complications . In CABG-only patients , no significant differences were seen in outcomes between diabetic and nondiabetic patients . Independent of diabetic status , glucose > or = 11 mmol/l on ICU admission was predictive of higher rates of mortality and renal , pulmonary , and cardiac postoperative complications . A combination of IV insulin -LRB- in the ICU -RRB- and SC insulin -LRB- outside the ICU -RRB- , a less costly and less nursing-intensive therapy than 3 days of IV insulin postoperatively , results in a reduction of the increased surgical morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients after CT surgery . We sought to study the optimal management of hyperglycemia in non-intensive care unit patients with type 2 diabetes , as few studies thus far have focused on the subject . We conducted a prospective , multicenter , randomized trial to compare the efficacy and safety of a basal-bolus insulin regimen with that of sliding-scale regular insulin -LRB- SSI -RRB- in patients with type 2 diabetes . A total of 130 insulin-naive patients were randomized to receive glargine and glulisine -LRB- n = 65 -RRB- or a standard SSI protocol -LRB- n = 65 -RRB- . Glargine was given once daily and glulisine before meals at a starting dose of 0.4 units x kg -LRB- -1 -RRB- x day -LRB- -1 -RRB- for blood glucose 140-200 mg/dl or 0.5 units x kg -LRB- -1 -RRB- x day -LRB- -1 -RRB- for blood glucose 201-400 mg/dl . SSI was given four times per day for blood glucose > 140 mg/dl . The mean admission blood glucose was 229 + / - 6 mg/dl and A1C 8.8 + / - 2 % . A blood glucose target of < 140 mg/dl was achieved in 66 % of patients in the glargine and glulisine group and in 38 % of those in the SSI group . The mean daily blood glucose between groups ranged from 23 to 58 mg/dl , with an overall blood glucose difference of 27 mg/dl -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- . Despite increasing insulin doses , 14 % of patients treated with SSI remained with blood glucose > 240 mg/dl . There were no differences in the rate of hypoglycemia or length of hospital stay . Treatment with insulin glargine and glulisine resulted in significant improvement in glycemic control compared with that achieved with the use of SSI alone . Our study indicates that a basal-bolus insulin regimen is preferred over SSI in the management of non-critically ill , hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes . Studies comparing the use of basal bolus with insulin analogs vs. split-mixed regimens with human insulins in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes are lacking . In a controlled multicenter trial , we randomized 130 nonsurgical patients with blood glucose -LRB- BG -RRB- between 140 and 400 mg/dl to receive detemir once daily and aspart before meals -LRB- n = 67 -RRB- or neutral protamine Hagedorn -LRB- NPH -RRB- and regular insulin twice daily -LRB- n = 63 -RRB- . Insulin dose was started at 0.4 U/kg . d for BG between 140 and 200 mg/dl or 0.5 U/kg . d for BG 201-400 mg/dl . Major study outcomes included differences in mean daily BG levels and frequency of hypoglycemic events between treatment groups . A BG target below 140 mg/dl before meals was achieved in 45 % of patients in the detemir/aspart group and 48 % in the NPH/regular group -LRB- P = 0.86 -RRB- . During treatment , 22 patients -LRB- 32.8 % -RRB- in the detemir/aspart group and 16 patients -LRB- 25.4 % -RRB- in the NPH/regular group had at least one episode of hypoglycemia -LRB- BG < 60 mg/dl -RRB- during the hospital stay -LRB- P = 0.34 -RRB- . Treatment with basal/bolus regimen with detemir once daily and aspart before meals results in equivalent glycemic control and no differences in the frequency of hypoglycemia compared to a split-mixed regimen of NPH and regular insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes . We examined the impact of an aspart insulin protocol for treatment of hyperglycemia in the emergency department -LRB- ED -RRB- coupled with rapid initiation of a detemir-aspart insulin protocol for patients admitted to the hospital . ED patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a blood glucose -LRB- BG -RRB- ≥ 200 mg/dL were randomized to intervention -LRB- INT -RRB- or usual care -LRB- UC -RRB- . INT patients -LRB- n = 87 -RRB- received aspart every 2 hours when BG > 200 mg/dL , and if admitted , began daily detemir in the ED . UC patients -LRB- n = 89 -RRB- were treated per hospital physicians . The initial ED BG was 304 ± 76 mg/dL . The final ED BG differed : 217 ± 71 mg/dL for INT patients versus 257 ± 89 mg/dL for UC patients -LRB- P < .01 -RRB- . No INT patients and 3 UC patients had a BG < 50 mg/dL -LRB- P = .5 -RRB- . ED length of stay -LRB- LOS -RRB- was similar : 5.4 ± 1.8 hours for INT patients versus 4.9 ± 1.9 hours for UC patients -LRB- P = .06 -RRB- . Sixty-nine percent from each group were admitted . Admission BG was 184 ± 74 mg/dL for INT patients versus 224 ± 93 mg/dL for UC patients -LRB- P < .01 -RRB- . Patient-day weighted mean glucose was 163 ± 39 mg/dL for INT patients versus 202 ± 39 mg/dL for UC patients -LRB- P < .01 -RRB- . One INT patient and 6 UC patients had a BG < 50 mg/dL -LRB- P = .11 -RRB- . Hospital LOS was similar : 2.7 ± 2.0 versus 3.1 ± 1.9 days , respectively -LRB- P = .58 -RRB- . An aspart insulin protocol safely lowers BG levels in the ED without prolonging LOS . During hospitalization , a detemir-aspart protocol achieves significantly better glycemic control compared with guideline-driven use of NPH-aspart or glargine/detemir-aspart -LRB- usual care -RRB- without increasing hypoglycemia . Standardization of insulin protocols in the ED and hospital settings leads to improvement in overall glycemic control with greater safety and efficacy than usual care . The effect of intensive therapy to achieve tight glycemic control in patients hospitalized in non-critical care settings is unclear . We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of intensive glycemic control strategies on the outcomes of death , stroke , myocardial infarction , incidence of infection , and hypoglycemia . We included randomized and observational studies . Bibliographic databases were searched through February 2010 . Random effects model was used to pool results across studies . Nineteen studies -LRB- nine randomized and 10 observational studies -RRB- were included . The risk of bias across studies was moderate . Meta-analysis demonstrates that intensive glycemic control was not associated with significant effect on the risk of death , myocardial infarction , or stroke . There was a trend for increased risk of hypoglycemia -LRB- relative risk , 1.58 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.97-2.57 -RRB- , particularly in surgical studies and when the planned glycemic target was achieved . Intensive glycemic control was associated with decreased risk of infection -LRB- relative risk , 0.41 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.21-0.77 -RRB- that was mainly derived from studies in surgical settings . Intensive control of hyperglycemia in patients hospitalized in non-critical care settings may reduce the risk of infection . The quality of evidence is low and mainly driven by studies in surgical settings . We analyzed 137 episodes of hypoglycemia -LRB- serum glucose less than or equal to 49 mg per deciliter -RRB- occurring in 94 adult patients hospitalized during a six-month period at a tertiary care hospital . Forty-five percent of the patients had diabetes mellitus , and administered insulin was implicated in 90 percent of episodes in diabetics . Hypoglycemia in diabetic patients occurred under a variety of circumstances , frequently because of decreased caloric intake related to illness or hospital routine . Insulin-induced hypoglycemia also occurred during treatment of hyperkalemia -LRB- eight patients -RRB- or during hyperglycemia related to total parenteral nutrition -LRB- six patients -RRB- . Forty-six of the 94 patients had chronic renal insufficiency , and 20 of these 46 had underlying diabetes mellitus . Thus , renal insufficiency unrelated to diabetes mellitus was the second most frequent diagnosis associated with hypoglycemia . The majority of other cases of hypoglycemia were related to liver disease , infections , shock , pregnancy , neoplasia , or burns . Hypoglycemia was not the apparent cause of death in any patient , but the overall hospital mortality was 27 percent and was related to the degree of hypoglycemia and the number of risk factors for hypoglycemia . We conclude that hypoglycemia is a common problem in hospitalized patients , is common in renal insufficiency , is usually iatrogenic , and correlates with high mortality in severely ill patients . Hypoglycemia during hospitalization occurs in patients with and without diabetes . The aims of this study were to determine the incidence , associated risk factors , and short - and long-term outcome of hypoglycemia among hospitalized elderly patients . This is a case-control study conducted at geriatric and medicine departments . All patients 70 years or older with documented hypoglycemia hospitalized within 1 year -LRB- n = 281 -RRB- were compared with a nonhypoglycemic group of 281 elderly , randomly selected patients from the same hospitalized population . Among 5404 patients 70 years or older , 281 -LRB- 5.2 % -RRB- had documented hypoglycemia . Compared with the nonhypoglycemic group , we found the following characteristics to be true in the hypoglycemic group : there were more women than men -LRB- 58 % vs 44 % , P = .001 -RRB- ; sepsis was 10 times more common -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- ; malignancy was 2.8 times more common -LRB- P = .04 -RRB- ; the mean serum albumin level was lower -LRB- 2.8 g/dL vs 3.4 g/dL , P < .001 -RRB- ; and the mean serum creatinine and alkaline phosphatase levels were higher -LRB- P < .001 for both -RRB- . Diabetes was known in 42 % of the hypoglycemic group and in 31 % of the nonhypoglycemic group -LRB- P = .03 -RRB- ; 70 patients in the hypoglycemic group were taking sulfonylureas or insulin . Multivariate logistic analysis showed that sepsis , albumin level , malignancy , sulfonyurea and insulin treatment , alkaline phosphatase level , female sex , and creatinine level were all independent predictors of developing hypoglycemia . Multivariate analysis of mortality found that sepsis , low albumin level , and malignancy were independent predictors , while hypoglycmia was not . Hypoglycemia was common in elderly hospitalized patients and predicted increased in-hospital 3 - and 6-month cumulative mortality . However , in a multivariate analysis , hypoglycemia was not an independent predictor for mortality , implying that it is only a marker . To determine the incidence and manifestations of hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients receiving antihyperglycemic therapy . The study was a 3-month prospective review of consecutive medical records of all adult , nonpregnant hospitalized patients at a 675-bed university hospital who experienced at least 1 blood glucose -LRB- BG -RRB- < or = 60 mg/dL within 48 hours of receiving an antihyperglycemic agent . Of 2174 patients receiving antihyperglycemic agents , 206 -LRB- 9.5 % -RRB- experienced 484 hypoglycemic episodes . Of these episodes , 29 % occurred in patients with type 1 diabetes , 23 % in the ICU , and 72 % in patients receiving only insulin for hyperglycemia . More than 1 episode was experienced by 44 % of the 206 patients . Furthermore , 4 % -LRB- 20 of 484 -RRB- of the hypoglycemic episodes were associated with a hypoglycemia-related adverse event , defined as symptoms , signs , or injury . The mean BG of these episodes was 43.0 mg/dL , significantly lower than the mean BG of 50.9 mg/dL for the 464 episodes without adverse events -LRB- P = .01 -RRB- . One-third of the adverse events occurred with a BG between 50 and 60 mg/dL ; half the adverse events , 10 episodes or 2 % of all hypoglycemic episodes , were serious , involving seizures or an unresponsive patient . A decrease in enteral intake accounted for 40 % of the episodes ; none was attributed to medication error . Less than half the hypoglycemic patients had documented euglycemia within 2 hours . Sulfonylurea agents were associated with higher rates of hypoglycemia than were other oral agents . Hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients taking antihyperglycemic agents is common ; 1 in 25 episodes is associated with an adverse event . Opportunities exist to improve care , particularly around discontinuation of feeding . Hypoglycemia is often cited as a barrier to achieving inpatient glycemic targets . We sought to characterize hypoglycemic events in our institution by work-shift cycle and by specific treatment area . Capillary -LRB- bedside -RRB- and blood -LRB- laboratory -RRB- glucose values of < 70 mg/dl for patients with either a known diagnosis of diabetes or with evidence of hyperglycemia were abstracted from our laboratory database for hospitalizations between October 1 , 2007 , and February 3 , 2008 . Hypoglycemic events were analyzed by 12 h nursing work-shift cycles -LRB- day shift , 07:00 to 18:59 ; night shift , 19:00 to 06:59 -RRB- and by the six medical , surgical , and intensive care areas in the hospital -LRB- designated areas 1 to 6 -RRB- . We identified 206 individual patients with either diabetes or hyperglycemia -LRB- mean age , 67 years ; 56 % men ; 83 % white -RRB- who had 423 hypoglycemic events . There were 78 % more hypoglycemic events during the night shift -LRB- n = 271 events in 128 individual patients -RRB- than during the day shift -LRB- n = 152 events in 96 individual patients -RRB- . Most of the night-shift hypoglycemic measurements were detected between 04:00 and 04:59 or 06:00 and 06:59 . The mean hypoglycemic level was comparable between shifts -LRB- p = .79 -RRB- and across the six inpatient areas . The number of hypoglycemic events per person increased with lengths of hospital stay > 5 days . The prevalence of hypoglycemia varied across patient care areas within the hospital , with most -LRB- 28 % -RRB- detected in one area of the hospital . There are temporal and geographic patterns in the occurrence of hypoglycemia among patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia in our hospital . Further study should focus on the reasons underlying these variations so that specific interventions can address the risk of hypoglycemia during peak times and places . This study set out to determine the incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with chronic kidney disease -LRB- CKD -RRB- , with and without diabetes , and the association of hypoglycemia with mortality . This was a retrospective cohort analysis of 243,222 patients who had 2,040,206 glucose measurements and were cared for at the Veterans Health Administration . CKD was defined as an estimated GFR of < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m -LRB- 2 -RRB- . Hypoglycemia was set at < 70 mg/dl . Mortality was measured 1 day after glucose measurement . The incidence of hypoglycemia was higher in patients with CKD versus without CKD . Among patients with diabetes , the rate was 10.72 versus 5.33 per 100 patient-months and among patients without diabetes was 3.46 versus 2.23 per 100 patient-months , for CKD versus no CKD , respectively . The odds of 1-d mortality were increased at all levels of hypoglycemia but attenuated in CKD versus no CKD . Adjusted odds ratios for 1-d mortality that were associated with glucose values of < 50 , 50 to 59 , and 60 to 69 mg/dl , respectively , versus glucose of > or = 70 mg/dl were 6.09 , 4.10 , and 1.85 for inpatient records from patients with CKD ; 9.95 , 3.79 , and 2.54 for inpatients records from patients without CKD ; 6.84 , 3.28 , and 3.98 for outpatient records from patients with CKD ; and 13.28 , 7.36 , and 4.34 for outpatient records from patients without CKD . CKD is a risk for hypoglycemia , with or without diabetes . The excessive mortality associated with hypoglycemia makes this complication a significant threat to patient safety in CKD . To quantify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of regular insulin and insulin lispro in type 1 diabetic patients with and without overt diabetic nephropathy . In this double-blind , two-way cross-over , euglycemic -LRB- 5 mmol/l -RRB- glucose clamp study , we investigated the metabolic response to subcutaneous injections of regular insulin and insulin lispro -LRB- 0.2 U/kg -RRB- in 12 type 1 diabetic patients with overt diabetic nephropathy -LRB- proteinuria > 500 mg/24 h and/or serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl ; NP group -RRB- and in a control group of 12 type 1 diabetic patients with normal renal function -LRB- DC group -RRB- . Peak plasma free insulin levels with insulin lispro -LRB- 359 -LSB- NP -RSB- vs. 254 pmol/l -LSB- DC -RSB- -RRB- were higher and time to maximal insulin concentrations -LRB- 85 -LSB- NP -RSB- vs. 99 min -LSB- DC -RSB- -RRB- shorter than with regular insulin -LRB- 213 -LSB- NP -RSB- vs. 144 pmol/l -LSB- DC -RSB- ; 118 -LSB- NP -RSB- vs. 153 min -LSB- DC -RSB- -RRB- in both patient groups . Overall insulin levels for regular insulin and for insulin lispro were higher in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy compared with control patients . Time to maximal metabolic effect was shorter with insulin lispro than with regular insulin in both patient groups -LRB- 102 vs. 191 min -LSB- NP -RSB- ; 105 vs. 172 min -LSB- DC -RSB- -RRB- . The overall metabolic effect of regular insulin but not of insulin lispro was lower in patients with diabetic nephropathy than in diabetic control patients -LRB- 967 vs. 1,510 mg/kg , respectively -RRB- . Although insulin levels are higher in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy , the metabolic response to regular insulin is reduced . Insulin lispro maintains its characteristic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy . In the presence of impaired renal function , patients require less insulin mainly because insulin clearance is prolonged . The aim of this study was to evaluate the insulin requirement related to glomerular filtration rate -LRB- GFR -RRB- in nephropathic Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients . In a retrospective study we compared insulin requirement in 20 nephropathic Type 1 diabetic patients and 20 insulin-treated Type 2 diabetic patients from the onset of overt nephropathy until the final stage of renal disease . All patients had proteinuria > 0.5 g/24 h and creatinine clearance > / = 80 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at baseline . Creatinine clearance , urinary protein excretion , glycated haemoglobin and the required insulin doses were determined 3 - to 6-monthly , basal C-peptide was measured at the beginning and the end of the observation period . The required insulin doses were evaluated at creatinine clearance rates of 80 , 60 , 40 , 20 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 -LRB- or at the initiation of dialysis treatment -RRB- . The insulin requirement of patients with Type 1 diabetes was reduced from 0.72 + / - 0.16 IU/kg per day at a creatinine clearance rate of 80 ml/min , to 0.45 + / - 0.13 IU/kg per day at a creatinine clearance rate of 10 ml/min -LRB- decrement of 38 % , P < 0.001 -RRB- . The insulin dose required by Type 2 diabetic patients was reduced from 0.68 + / - 0.28 IU/kg per day at a creatinine clearance rate of 80 ml/min to 0.33 + / - 0.19 IU/kg per day at a clearance rate of 10 ml/min -LRB- decrement 51 % , P < 0.001 -RRB- . The fall in GFR , urinary protein excretion and glycated haemoglobin levels was similar in the two groups . In patients with Type 2 diabetes , C-peptide levels at the beginning and the end of renal function impairment were 2.2 -LRB- 0.4-7.3 -RRB- vs. 2.7 -LRB- 0.1-4.9 -RRB- ng/ml -LRB- NS -RRB- . The reduction in insulin requirement was approximately the same in patients with an initial C-peptide level < 1.0 and in those > / = 1.0 ng/ml -LRB- decrement 57 % vs. 46 % -RRB- . The reduction in insulin requirement in renal insufficiency is similar in Type 1 and insulin-treated Type 2 diabetic patients . In subjects with Type 2 diabetes , the residual insulin secretion has no impact on the reduction in insulin requirement dependent on the GFR .
