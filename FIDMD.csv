1	positive	none	none	none	Clonidine can effectively reduce pain and/or hypersensitivity . However , the antihypersensitivity effects of clonidine topically applied in cream -LRB- CC -RRB- have not been investigated . The authors evaluated effects of topical application of CC on pain behaviors and spinal Fos-like immunoreactivity in rats with hypersensitivity . Clonidine -LRB- 30 , 100 , and 300 microg/g -RRB- was prepared in a cream base . In rat models of neuropathic pain , inflammatory pain , and postoperative pain , the authors evaluated effects of CC -LRB- 0.1 g -RRB- , topically applied onto the plantar surface of the injured or uninjured paw , on thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia to von Frey filaments . The authors also evaluated effects of CC on lumbar spinal Fos-like immunoreactivity . In neuropathic rats , CC applied onto the injured paw reduced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia dose dependently , whereas CC applied onto the uninjured paw had no effect . Further , CC reduced Fos-like immunoreactivity in neuropathic rats . In rats with postoperative pain , CC repeatedly applied for 6 days reduced thermal hyperalgesia , but not mechanical allodynia , in the postoperative days , whereas it had no effects on hyperalgesia or allodynia in those with inflammatory pain . Topical CC in concentrations examined significantly reduced hypersensitivity and lumbar spinal Fos-like immunoreactivity in rats with neuropathic pain , probably through activation of peripherally located alpha2 adrenoceptors . However , CC was only partially effective and totally ineffective in rats with postoperative pain and inflammatory pain , respectively . In this population-based telephone survey , we evaluated the attitudes of 302 adults toward analgesic use and related side effects . Over half -LRB- 68 % -RRB- reported prior experience with 2 or more side effects . Vomiting -LRB- 34 % -RRB- , confusion -LRB- 32 % -RRB- , and nausea -LRB- 17 % -RRB- were ranked as the worst side effects . Exploratory cluster analysis grouped responses to 6 questions about willingness to use analgesics into two categories . Participants in Cluster I -LRB- n = 106 -RRB- , `` Conservatives , '' were less willing to take analgesics for pain as compared to those in Cluster II -LRB- n = 153 -RRB- , `` Liberals . '' Univariate analysis found Hispanics , women , those less affluent or educated , and those with prior side-effect experience were more likely to be Conservative . Experience with side effects -LRB- OR = 1.3 -RRB- and being female -LRB- OR = 2.1 -RRB- were the strongest predictors of conservative cluster membership . To achieve better pain outcomes , clinicians and patients must identify factors that contribute to conservative decision-making about analgesic use and side effect management .

2	negative	conflict	ERAS benefits may translate even on the baby .	ERAS benefits may translate even on the outbreak of pre-existing micrometastases and the initiation of new metastases .	Surgery for the removal of a primary tumor presents an opportunity to eradicate cancer or arrest its progression , but is also believed to promote the outbreak of pre-existing micrometastases and the initiation of new metastases . These deleterious effects of surgery are mediated through various mechanisms , including psychological and physiological neuroendocrine and paracrine stress responses elicited by surgery . In this review we -LRB- i -RRB- describe the many risk factors that arise during the perioperative period , acting synergistically to make this short timeframe critical for determining long-term cancer recurrence , -LRB- ii -RRB- present newly identified potent immunocyte populations that can destroy autologous tumor cells that were traditionally considered immune-resistant , thus invigorating the notion of immune-surveillance against cancer metastasis , -LRB- iii -RRB- describe in vivo evidence in cancer patients that support a role for anti-cancer immunity , -LRB- iv -RRB- indicate neuroendocrine and paracrine mediating mechanisms of stress - and surgery-induced promotion of cancer progression , focusing on the prominent role of catecholamines and prostaglandins through their impact on anti-cancer immunity , and through direct effects on the malignant tissue and its surrounding , -LRB- v -RRB- discuss the impact of different anesthetic approaches and other intra-operative procedures on immunity and cancer progression , and -LRB- vi -RRB- suggest prophylactic measures against the immunosuppressive and cancer promoting effects of surgery . Surgical removal of a tumor may , ironically , unleash prometastatic effects that enhance cancer recurrence and metastatic disease . The patient 's physiologic response to the surgical trauma may increase tumor cell growth and invasiveness while diminishing the immune system 's ability to eliminate residual disease . At the same time anaesthetic drugs used to accomplish the surgery may also have important effects on cancer cells and the immune system . Those combined effects potentially lead to sooner recurrence of local or metastatic cancer , and , ultimately , decreased survival . This review explores current research on the influences of surgery and anaesthesia on tumor cells , the immune system , and cancer recurrence . Although a substantial body of evidence sheds much light on the nature of these processes and is at times suggestive of how they might be relevant in clinical practice that literature also reveals a foundation of data that remain largely preclinical with as yet insufficient human study to support clinical recommendations . The tantalizing possibility that anaesthetic care of the surgical oncology patient might affect long term oncologic outcome remains unproven speculation , awaiting prospective human study . ERAS approach -LRB- Enhanced Recovery After Surgery -RRB- is a multimodal , perioperative pathway designed to achieve early recovery after surgery . ERAS has shown documented efficacy in elective surgery , and the concept of `` multimodal '' and `` multidisciplinary '' approach seems still to be of higher importance than each single item within ERAS protocols . Obstetric surgery , as well , may open wide horizons for future research , since extremely poor data are currently available , and ERAS benefits may translate even on the baby . Finally , the concept of `` outcome '' may be extended when considering the specific setting of cancer surgery , in which variables like cancer recurrence , early access to adjuvant therapies , and , finally , long-term survival are as important as the reduced perioperative complications . In this perspective , different items within ERAS protocols should be reinterpreted and eventually integrated towards `` protective '' techniques , to develop cancer-specific ERAS approaches keeping pace with the specific aims of oncologic surgery . Fulfilling patient expectations is central to defining a good quality of life -LRB- QoL -RRB- in health . The WHOQOL-BREF was developed using novel , person-centred methods and is a generic patient-reported outcomes measure -LRB- PROM -RRB- . However , without robust psychometric performance , PROMs can not be relied upon to assess individuals . This study investigated the WHOQOL-BREF -LRB- UK -RRB- , with this use in mind . Cross sectional with nested repeated measures . Twenty-seven disease groups or health conditions and healthy people were recruited at 38 UK sites , in a wide range of settings -LRB- n = 4628 -RRB- . ` Treatment as usual ' ; new and alternative interventions . WHOQOL-BREF -LRB- UK -RRB- ; SF-36 . Respondent burden was low , as acceptability and feasibility were high . Distinctive QoL profiles were found for diverse conditions . Musculoskeletal , psychiatric and cardiovascular patients reported the poorest QoL and also improved most during treatment . Overall , QoL was good , and best for healthy groups , supporting discriminant validity . Compared with the SF-36 , WHOQOL physical and psychological domains showed good concurrent validity , although social was weak . Small or moderate effect sizes confirmed responsiveness to change in specified domains for certain conditions and interventions . Age had a small impact on reporting QoL . The WHOQOL-BREF is found to be a high quality patient-centred generic tool suited to individual assessment in clinics , for research , and audit .	Obstetric surgery , as well , may open wide horizons for future research , since extremely poor data are currently available , and ERAS benefits may translate even on the outbreak of pre-existing micrometastases and the initiation of new metastases . In this study , we investigated the efficacy of the surgical oncology of the immunity . ERAS PROM sizes were observed in the two groups -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- . ERAS has shown documented efficacy in elective surgery , and the concept of `` multimodal '' and `` multidisciplinary '' approach seems still to be relevant in clinical practice that literature also reveals a foundation of data that remain largely preclinical with as yet insufficient human cancer or cancer progression , and -LRB- vi -RRB- suggest prophylactic measures against the immunosuppressive and cancer promoting effects of different anesthetic approaches and other assessment in clinics , and , finally , long-term survival are as the long term of cancer patients that support clinical to adjuvant therapies , and social was weak single item within pace with the specific tumor recurrence , the immune system 's ability to eliminate residual disease promoting effects to cancer micrometastases and audit .

The middle trapezius is primarily a medial stabilizer of the humeral head 	OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this manuscript is to review current knowledge of how muscle activation and force production contribute to shoulder kinematics in healthy subjects and persons with shoulder impingement . RESULTS : The middle and lower serratus anterior muscles produce scapular upward rotation , posterior tilting , and external rotation . Upper trapezius produces clavicular elevation and retraction . The middle trapezius is primarily a medial stabilizer of the scapula . The rotator cuff is critical to stabilization and prevention of excess superior translation of the humeral head , as well as production of glenohumeral external rotation during arm elevation . Alterations in activation amplitude or timing have been identified across various investigations of subjects with shoulder impingement as compared to healthy controls . These include decreased activation of the middle or lower serratus anterior and rotator cuff , delayed activation of middle and lower trapezius , and increased activation of the upper trapezius and middle deltoid in impingement subjects . In addition , subjects with a short resting length of the pectoralis minor exhibit altered scapular kinematic patterns similar to those found in persons with shoulder impingement . CONCLUSION : These normal muscle functional capabilities and alterations in patient populations should be considered when planning exercise approaches for the rehabilitation of these patients .

5	positive				Diabetic eye disease remains a major cause of blindness in the world . Laser treatment for proliferative diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema became available more than two decades ago . The outcome of treatment depends on the timing of laser treatment . The laser treatment is optimally delivered when high-risk characteristics have developed in proliferative retinopathy or diabetic macular edema and before this has significantly affected vision . Laser treatment is usually successful if applied during this optimal period whereas the treatment benefit falls sharply if the treatment is applied too late . In order to optimize the timing of laser treatment in diabetic eye disease screening programs have been established . In this paper the organisation and methods of screening programs are described including direct and photographic screening . The incidence and prevalence of blindness is much lower in populations where screening for diabetic eye disease has been established compared to diabetic populations without screening . Technical advantages may allow increased efficiency and telescreening . From a public health standpoint screening for diabetic eye disease is one of the most cost effective health procedures available . Diabetic eye disease can be prevented using existing technology and the cost involved is many times less than the cost of diabetic blindness . Müller cells are active players in normal retinal function and in virtually all forms of retinal injury and disease . Reactive Müller cells protect the tissue from further damage and preserve tissue function by the release of antioxidants and neurotrophic factors , and may contribute to retinal regeneration by the generation of neural progenitor/stem cells . However , Müller cell gliosis can also contribute to neurodegeneration and impedes regenerative processes in the retinal tissue by the formation of glial scars . This article provides an overview of the neuroprotective and detrimental effects of Müller cell gliosis , with accounts on the cellular signal transduction mechanisms and factors which are implicated in Müller cell-mediated neuroprotection , immunomodulation , regulation of Müller cell proliferation , upregulation of intermediate filaments , glial scar formation , and the generation of neural progenitor/stem cells . A proper understanding of the signaling mechanisms implicated in gliotic alterations of Müller cells is essential for the development of efficient therapeutic strategies that increase the supportive/protective and decrease the destructive roles of gliosis . Diabetic retinopathy is a common and specific microvascular complication of diabetes , and remains the leading cause of preventable blindness in working-aged people . It is identified in a third of people with diabetes and associated with increased risk of life-threatening systemic vascular complications , including stroke , coronary heart disease , and heart failure . Optimum control of blood glucose , blood pressure , and possibly blood lipids remains the foundation for reduction of risk of retinopathy development and progression . Timely laser therapy is effective for preservation of sight in proliferative retinopathy and macular oedema , but its ability to reverse visual loss is poor . Vitrectomy surgery might occasionally be needed for advanced retinopathy . The outlook for future treatment modalities , such as inhibition of other angiogenic factors , regenerative therapy , and topical therapy , is promising . Diabetic retinopathy -LRB- DR -RRB- remains a major cause of worldwide preventable blindness . The microvasculature of the retina responds to hyperglycemia through a number of biochemical changes , including activation of protein kinase C , increased advanced glycation end products formation , polyol pathway , and oxidative stress , and activation of the renin angiotensin system -LRB- RAS -RRB- . There is an accumulating body of evidence that inflammation plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of DR. The causes of retinal hypoxia are many and varied . Under hypoxic conditions , a variety of soluble factors are secreted into the vitreous cavity including growth factors , cytokines , and chemokines . Cytokines , which usually serve as signals between neighboring cells , are involved in essentially every important biological process , including cell proliferation , inflammation , immunity , migration , fibrosis , tissue repair , and angiogenesis . Cytokines and chemokines are multifunctional mediators that can direct the recruitment of leukocytes to sites of inflammation , promote the process , enhance immune responses , and promote stem cell survival , development , and homeostasis . The modern particle-based flow cytometric analysis is more direct , stable and sensitive than the colorimetric readout of the conventional ELISA but , similar to ELISA , is influenced by vitreous hemorrhage , disruption of the blood-retina barrier , and high serum levels of a specific protein . Finding patterns in the expression of inflammatory cytokines specific to a particular disease can substantially contribute to the understanding of its basic mechanism and to the development of a targeted therapy . Diabetic retinopathy -LRB- DR -RRB- remains a major cause of blindness as the prevalence of diabetes is expected to approximately double globally between 2000 and 2030 . DR progresses over time at different rates in different individuals with only a limited number developing significant vision loss due to the two major vision-threatening complications , clinically significant macular edema and proliferative retinopathy . Good metabolic control is important to prevent and delay progression , but whereas some patients escape vision loss even with poor control , others develop vision loss despite good metabolic control . Our research group has been able to identify three different DR phenotypes characterized by different dominant retinal alterations and different risks of progression to vision-threatening complications . Microaneurysm turnover has been validated as a prognostic biomarker of development of clinically significant macular edema , whereas subclinical macular edema identified by OCT and mfERG appear to be also good candidates as organ-specific biomarkers of DR. Hemoglobin A1c remains the only confirmed systemic prognostic biomarker of DR progression . The availability of biomarkers of DR progression and the identification of different phenotypes of DR with different risks for development of vision-threatening complications offers new perspectives for understanding DR and for its personalized management . There is growing evidence that chronic inflammation plays a role in both the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy . There is also evidence that molecules produced as a result of hyperglycemia can activate microglia . However the exact contribution of microglia , the resident immune cells of the central nervous system , to retinal tissue damage during diabetes remains unclear . Current data suggest that dysregulated microglial responses are linked to their deleterious effects in several neurological diseases associated with chronic inflammation . As inflammatory cytokines and hyperglycemia disseminate through the diabetic retina , microglia can change to an activated state , increase in number , translocate through the retina , and themselves become the producers of inflammatory and apoptotic molecules or alternatively exert anti-inflammatory effects . In addition , microglial genetic variations may account for some of the individual differences commonly seen in patient 's susceptibility to diabetic retinopathy . Diabetic retinopathy -LRB- DR -RRB- is the leading cause of visual impairment in the working-age population of the Western world . The pathogenesis of DR is complex and several vascular , inflammatory , and neuronal mechanisms are involved . Inflammation mediates structural and molecular alterations associated with DR. However , the molecular mechanisms underlying the inflammatory pathways associated with DR are not completely characterized . Previous studies indicate that tissue hypoxia and dysregulation of immune responses associated with diabetes mellitus can induce increased expression of numerous vitreous mediators responsible for DR development . Thus , analysis of vitreous humor obtained from diabetic patients has made it possible to identify some of the mediators -LRB- cytokines , chemokines , and other factors -RRB- responsible for DR pathogenesis . Further studies are needed to better understand the relationship between inflammation and DR. Herein the main vitreous-related factors triggering the occurrence of retinal complication in diabetes are highlighted . Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working age adults , and is projected to be a significant future health concern due to the rising incidence of diabetes . The recent advent of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor -LRB- VEGF -RRB- antibodies has revolutionized the treatment of diabetic retinopathy but a significant subset of patients fail to respond to treatment . Accumulating evidence indicates that inflammatory cytokines and chemokines other than VEGF may contribute to the disease process . The current review examines the presence of non-VEGF cytokines in the eyes of patients with diabetic retinopathy and highlights mechanistic pathways in relevant animal models . Finally , novel drug targets including components of the kinin-kallikrein system and emerging treatments such as anti-HPTP -LRB- human protein tyrosine phosphatase -RRB- β antibodies are discussed . Recognition of non-VEGF contributions to disease pathogenesis may lead to novel therapeutics to enhance existing treatments for patients who do not respond to anti-VEGF therapies .	DR progresses over time at different rates in different individuals with only a limited number developing significant vision loss due to the two major vision-threatening complications , clinically significant macular edema and before this has significantly affected vision . There was no significant differences in the incidence of retinopathy development and progression of the retinopathy of the treatment group -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- . The incidence of DR progression was significantly higher in the two groups . Diabetic retinopathy is a common and specific microvascular complication of diabetes , and remains the leading cause of the development of glial scars -LRB- e.g. -RRB- , and the generation of neural progenitor/stem -LRB- n = 6 -RRB- . Diabetic eye disease can be prevented using existing technology and the cost of DR. The causes of the targeted cavity of diabetic factors , and topical therapy , and visual loss , others develop OCT and coronary heart disease , and heart failure . Diabetic retinopathy -LRB- DR -RRB- remains secreted into the most cost effective health procedures available for diabetic eye disease screening programs have been established compared to diabetic populations without screening and diabetic remains the foundation for the effect of the diabetic responses .
6	negative	conflict	5-year LPFS 	A moderate dose of radiation is the recommended treatment for solitary plasmacytoma -LRB- SP -RRB- , but there is controversy over the role of surgery . Our study aimed at comparing different treatment modalities in the management of SP. . Data from 38 consecutive patients with solitary plasmacytoma , including 16 with bone plasmacytoma and 22 with extramedullary plasmacytoma , were retrospectively reviewed . 15 patients received radiotherapy alone ; 11 received surgery alone , and 12 received both . The median radiation dose was 50Gy . All operations were performed as radical resections . Local progression-free survival -LRB- LPFS -RRB- , multiple myeloma-free survival -LRB- MMFS -RRB- , progression-free survival -LRB- PFS -RRB- and overall survival -LRB- OS -RRB- were calculated and outcomes of different therapies were compared . The median follow-up time was 55 months . 5-year LPFS , MMFS , PFS and OS were 87.0 % , 80.9 % , 69.8 % and 87.4 % , respectively . Univariate analysis revealed , compared with surgery alone , radiotherapy alone was associated with significantly higher 5-year LPFS -LRB- 100 % vs 69.3 % , p = 0.016 -RRB- , MMFS -LRB- 100 % vs 51.4 % , p = 0.006 -RRB- , PFS -LRB- 100 % vs 33.7 % , p = 0.0004 -RRB- and OS -LRB- 100 % vs 70 % , p = 0.041 -RRB- . Radiotherapy alone can be considered as a more effective treatment for SP over surgery . Whether a combination of radiotherapy and surgery improves outcomes requires further study . To assess the outcomes and patterns of failure in solitary plasmacytoma -LRB- SP -RRB- . The data from 258 patients with bone -LRB- n = 206 -RRB- or extramedullary -LRB- n = 52 -RRB- SP without evidence of multiple myeloma -LRB- MM -RRB- were collected . A histopathologic diagnosis was obtained for all patients . The median radiation dose was 40 Gy . The median follow-up was 56 months -LRB- range 7-245 -RRB- . The median time to MM development was 21 months -LRB- range 2-135 -RRB- , with a 5-year probability of 45 % . The 5-year overall survival , disease-free survival , and local control rate was 74 % , 50 % , and 86 % , respectively . On multivariate analyses , the favorable factors were younger age and tumor size < 4 cm for survival ; younger age , extramedullary localization , and RT for disease-free survival ; and small tumor and RT for local control . Bone localization was the only predictor of MM development . Progression to MM remains the main problem . Patients with extramedullary SP had the best outcomes , especially when treated with moderate-dose RT. . Chemotherapy and/or novel therapies should be investigated for bone or bulky extramedullary SP. . The Cyberknife delivers frameless image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery to intracranial and extracranial tumors . We report our use of Cyberknife radiosurgery on a medullary plasmacytoma in the clivus extending into the foramen magnum . No acute toxicity was seen during or within 24 hours of treatment , and the subject had a complete and durable radiographic response on MRI 12 + months after treatment . To our knowledge , this is a first case of successful Cyberknife radiosurgery of a medullary plasmacytoma .	The median time to MM development was 21 months -LRB- range 2-135 -RRB- , with RT for disease-free survival ; and small tumor and RT for local control . At 24 hours , the median radiation dose was significantly higher -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- . There was no significant difference in radiation dose -LRB- PFS -RRB- . The 5-year overall survival , disease-free survival , and local control rate was 74 % , 50 % , and 86 % , respectively . On multivariate analyses , the favorable factors were younger age and tumor -LRB- n = 52 -RRB- SP without evidence of multiple myeloma -LRB- 100 % vs 70 % , p = 0.041 -RRB- . Radiotherapy alone can be considered as a more effective treatment for SP over surgery . All patients with extramedullary SP had the best outcomes , especially when treated with moderate-dose RT. -LRB- MM -RRB- were collected as controversy over the role of surgery .

8	positive	none			Regulation of FSH secretion in the male involves a complex balance between stimulation by GnRH from the hypothalamus , inhibitory feedback by sex steroids -LRB- T and E2 -RRB- and inhibin B -LRB- Inh B -RRB- from the gonads , and autocrine/paracrine modulation by activin and follistatin within the pituitary . The aim of the present study was to delineate the feedback control of FSH in the human male with specific reference to the relative roles of sex steroids vs. Inh B. Two experimental human models were used : 1 -RRB- normal -LRB- NL -RRB- men subjected to acute sex steroid withdrawal -LRB- - T , - E2 , + Inh B -RRB- , and 2 -RRB- functional castrate males -LRB- - T , - E2 , - Inh B -RRB- . Nine NL men -LRB- age range , 25-45 yr -RRB- and three castrate males -LRB- age range , 23-47 yr -RRB- were studied . Gonadotropin secretion was characterized by frequent blood sampling every 10 min for 12 h at baseline and on d 3 and 6 of sex steroid ablation . In the three castrate subjects , blood sampling was performed every 5 min for 24 h 8 wk after discontinuing androgen replacement therapy . In the NL men , treatment with ketoconazole resulted in a decline to castrate levels in T -LRB- 451 + / - 20 to 38 + / - 7 ng/dl ; P < 0.0005 -RRB- and E2 -LRB- 39 + / - 4 to 15 + / - 2 pg/ml ; P < 0.005 -RRB- and a modest , but significant , decline in Inh B levels , which remained within the normal range -LRB- 183 + / - 19 to 136 + / - 13 pg/ml ; P < 0.005 -RRB- . This suppression of sex steroids was associated with a more marked increase in mean LH -LRB- 9.5 + / - 0.9 to 24.9 + / - 2.0 IU/liter ; P < 0.0001 -RRB- than FSH levels -LRB- 5.1 + / - 0.7 to 10.0 + / - 1.5 IU/liter ; P < 0.005 -RRB- , with the latter not exceeding the normal adult male range . The castrate subjects had a mean T level of 66 + / - 8 ng/dl , an E2 level of 20 + / - 1 pg/ml , and undetectable Inh B levels . Despite a similar sex steroid milieu , the mean FSH levels observed in NL men after acute sex steroid ablation were approximately 6-fold lower than those seen in the castrate subjects -LRB- 10.0 + / - 1.5 vs. 59.5 + / - 17.7 IU/liter ; P < 0.0005 -RRB- . In contrast , mean LH levels in the NL men were less than 3-fold lower than those in castrate subjects -LRB- 24.9 + / - 2.0 vs. 66.8 + / - 20.1 IU/liter ; P < 0.005 -RRB- . From this human model of acute sex steroid withdrawal , we conclude that Inh B is likely to be the major feedback regulator of FSH secretion in the human male . Adult patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism -LRB- IHH -RRB- typically present with absent puberty and therefore have prepubertal testes . IHH is recognized as one of the few curable causes of male infertility and is often effectively treated with either gonadotropins or pulsatile GnRH therapy . The objective of this study was to determine the structure of the testis prior to initiation of treatment . Eight adult IHH patients with prepubertal testes -LRB- < 4 ml -RRB- , with no previous gonadotropin therapy and with no history of cryptorchidism underwent open bilateral testicular biopsy prior to the initiation of hormonal treatment . The testes of all patients showed seminiferous cords separated by interstitium composed of blood vessels , connective tissue cells and collagen fibres but typical adult Leydig cells were absent . The cords contained only Sertoli cells and early type A spermatogonia . The spermatogonia mostly resided in the centre of the cords and were often large , typical of gonocytes . Sertoli cells appeared immature with ovoid nuclei devoid of infoldings and cytoplasm that lacked polarity . These results demonstrate that the immature testes from patients with the severe form of IHH possess early spermatogonia that could possibly reinitiate spermatogenesis with appropriate hormone stimulation . Therefore , the immature testis of this IHH subset resembles those of prepubertal boys and may provide important biologic and genetic insights into testicular development .	In the three castrate subjects , blood sampling was performed every 5 min for 24 h at baseline and on d 3 and 6 pg/ml ; P < 0.005 -RRB- and a modest , but significant , decline in Inh B levels , which remained within the normal gonadotropin therapy and with no history of cryptorchidism underwent open bilateral testicular biopsy prior to the latter not exceeding the normal adult male range . The castrate subjects had a mean T level of T -LRB- 451 + / - 2.4 mmol/L -RRB- were less than those in castrate subjects -LRB- 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , P < 0.001 -RRB- . The initiation of sex was significantly higher in the NL men -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- , and the castrate of hormonal treatment was significantly different in the castrate group -LRB- 95 + confidence interval , 0.43 to 0.99 + / -12.4 % ; P = 0.0005 -RRB- . In contrast , genetic insights was to determine the structure of the testis prior to initiation of treatment with appropriate hormone stimulation . IHH secretion was characterized by frequent blood sampling every 10 min 8 wk after discontinuing androgen replacement therapy .
9	positive	none			The sources of human exposure to low-frequency noise and its effects are reviewed . Low-frequency noise is common as background noise in urban environments , and as an emission from many artificial sources : road vehicles , aircraft , industrial machinery , artillery and mining explosions , and air movement machinery including wind turbines , compressors , and ventilation or air-conditioning units . The effects of low-frequency noise are of particular concern because of its pervasiveness due to numerous sources , efficient propagation , and reduced efficacy of many structures -LRB- dwellings , walls , and hearing protection -RRB- in attenuating low-frequency noise compared with other noise . Intense low-frequency noise appears to produce clear symptoms including respiratory impairment and aural pain . Although the effects of lower intensities of low-frequency noise are difficult to establish for methodological reasons , evidence suggests that a number of adverse effects of noise in general arise from exposure to low-frequency noise : Loudness judgments and annoyance reactions are sometimes reported to be greater for low-frequency noise than other noises for equal sound-pressure level ; annoyance is exacerbated by rattle or vibration induced by low-frequency noise ; speech intelligibility may be reduced more by low-frequency noise than other noises except those in the frequency range of speech itself , because of the upward spread of masking . On the other hand , it is also possible that low-frequency noise provides some protection against the effects of simultaneous higher frequency noise on hearing . Research needs and policy decisions , based on what is currently known , are considered . Wind turbine noise exposure and suspected health-related effects thereof have attracted substantial attention . Various symptoms such as sleep-related problems , headache , tinnitus and vertigo have been described by subjects suspected of having been exposed to wind turbine noise . This review was conducted systematically with the purpose of identifying any reported associations between wind turbine noise exposure and suspected health-related effects . A search of the scientific literature concerning the health-related effects of wind turbine noise was conducted on PubMed , Web of Science , Google Scholar and various other Internet sources . All studies investigating suspected health-related outcomes associated with wind turbine noise exposure were included . Wind turbines emit noise , including low-frequency noise , which decreases incrementally with increases in distance from the wind turbines . Likewise , evidence of a dose-response relationship between wind turbine noise linked to noise annoyance , sleep disturbance and possibly even psychological distress was present in the literature . Currently , there is no further existing statistically-significant evidence indicating any association between wind turbine noise exposure and tinnitus , hearing loss , vertigo or headache . Selection bias and information bias of differing magnitudes were found to be present in all current studies investigating wind turbine noise exposure and adverse health effects . Only articles published in English , German or Scandinavian languages were reviewed . Exposure to wind turbines does seem to increase the risk of annoyance and self-reported sleep disturbance in a dose-response relationship . There appears , though , to be a tolerable level of around LAeq of 35 dB . Of the many other claimed health effects of wind turbine noise exposure reported in the literature , however , no conclusive evidence could be found . Future studies should focus on investigations aimed at objectively demonstrating whether or not measureable health-related outcomes can be proven to fluctuate depending on exposure to wind turbines . This review examines the literature related to health effects of wind turbines . We reviewed literature related to sound measurements near turbines , epidemiological and experimental studies , and factors associated with annoyance . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Infrasound sound near wind turbines does not exceed audibility thresholds . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Epidemiological studies have shown associations between living near wind turbines and annoyance . -LRB- 3 -RRB- Infrasound and low-frequency sound do not present unique health risks . -LRB- 4 -RRB- Annoyance seems more strongly related to individual characteristics than noise from turbines . Further areas of inquiry include enhanced noise characterization , analysis of predicted noise values contrasted with measured levels postinstallation , longitudinal assessments of health pre - and postinstallation , experimental studies in which subjects are `` blinded '' to the presence or absence of infrasound , and enhanced measurement techniques to evaluate annoyance . The function of the organ was followed by measuring its physiological response . Static pressure applied in the basal coil caused a distention of the RM in the apical coil into the scala vestibuli . The sensitivity to a test tone was reduced . When the pressure was relieved , the RM returned to its original position and the response recovered . If the increased pressure was maintained , the RM would bulge further . The RM could then be reversibly stretched and return gradually , with a delay , to its original position . Alternatively , it could be over-stretched and return with an over-shoot past its original position toward the organ of Corti . In response to repetitive tone pulses of above 80 dB , hydrops of the RM also developed . This was accompanied by a reduced sensitivity . A slow recovery to the original position , or over-shoot , and return of responsiveness could be seen . Above 106 dB sustained loss was generally seen . It is concluded that the RM can accommodate increased scala media pressure by distention . This will relieve the organ of Corti from part of the pressure and may protect the organ from trauma . Low-frequency sounds presented at high nontraumatizing levels induce temporary hyperacusis in humans and animals . One explanation of this finding is that the basilar membrane operating point may be disturbed by an endolymph volume change . This possibility was investigated using volume and flow markers iontophoresed into the endolymphatic space of guinea pigs . Marker concentrations were measured with ion-selective microelectrodes placed apically and basally to the iontophoresis site during exposure of the ear to low-frequency tones . Concentration changes were interpreted quantitatively using a finite-element model of the endolymphatic space that allowed changes of endolymph cross-sectional area and flow to be derived . Stimulation with a 200 Hz tone at 115 dB SPL for 3 min produced marker concentration changes consistent with the induction of transient endolymphatic hydrops and a basally directed displacement of endolymph . Endocochlear potentials were greater than normal after the exposure when hydrops was present . During identical tone exposures of animals without marker , we found that action potential -LRB- AP -RRB- threshold changes and endolymph potassium changes associated with the hydropic state were small . Marker concentration changes were compared with changes in endocochlear potential and AP thresholds for a range of exposure frequencies and levels . AP hypersensitivity occurred with 200 Hz exposure levels below those inducing endolymph volume disturbances . Endolymph volume changes are thought to be the result of , rather than the cause of , changes in operating point of the cochlear transducer . The observations that auditory threshold and endolymph potassium changes are minimal under conditions where substantial endolymphatic hydrops is present is relevant to our understanding of the hearing loss in patients with Meniere 's disease . Responses of the ear to low-frequency and infrasonic sounds have not been extensively studied . Understanding how the ear responds to low frequencies is increasingly important as environmental infrasounds are becoming more pervasive from sources such as wind turbines . This study shows endolymphatic potentials in the third cochlear turn from acoustic infrasound -LRB- 5 Hz -RRB- are larger than from tones in the audible range -LRB- e.g. , 50 and 500 Hz -RRB- , in some cases with peak-to-peak amplitude greater than 20 mV . These large potentials were suppressed by higher-frequency tones and were rapidly abolished by perilymphatic injection of KCl at the cochlear apex , demonstrating their third-turn origins . Endolymphatic iso-potentials from 5 to 500 Hz were enhanced relative to perilymphatic potentials as frequency was lowered . Potentials were best explained as a saturating response summed with a sinusoidal voltage -LRB- Vo -RRB- , that was phase delayed by an average of 60 ° relative to the biasing effects of the infrasound . Vo is thought to arise indirectly from hair cell activity , such as from strial potential changes caused by sustained current changes through the hair cells in each half cycle of the infrasound . Low-frequency tones -LRB- LFT -RRB- and infrasound -LRB- IS -RRB- are looked upon as potentially hazardous to human health . We aimed at assessing LFT/IS-induced activation of the auditory cortex by using fMRI . fMRI was used to investigate LFT/IS perception in 17 healthy volunteers . Short tone bursts of 12 , 36 , 48 and 500 Hz were delivered directly into the right external ear canal through a 12-m long silicone tube and an ear plug . Sound pressure levels -LRB- SPL -RRB- and spectral analysis of the stimuli and scanner noise were measured in situ by using a metal-free optical microphone and a fiber-optic cable . SPL-dependent activation of the superior temporal gyrus , i.e. Brodmann areas -LRB- BA -RRB- 41 and 42 as well as BA 22 , was delineated subsequent to acoustic stimulation with 12 - , 48 - and 500-Hz stimuli . Thresholds for LFT/IS-induced brain activation were between 110 and 90 dB SPL in normal hearing subjects . Spectral analysis revealed the occurrence of harmonics together with LFT , of which 36-Hz harmonics interfered with IS exposure at 12 Hz as well as scanner noise . Our results provide evidence that auditory cortex activation may be induced by LFT/IS exposure , depending on sound pressure levels applied . Clinical implications of our findings will have to be addressed by subsequent studies involving patients presumptively suffering from LFT-dependent disorders . We investigated the relationship between Meniere 's disease and the abnormally enlarged summating potential -LRB- SP -RRB- in a series of patients and normal subjects . Cochlear and auditory nerve responses to rectangular-pulse clicks , delivered at a rate of 8/s and an intensity of 115 dB peak-equivalent sound pressure level , were recorded from ear canal skin . We performed a parabolic regression for SP amplitudes as a function of auditory nerve action potential -LRB- AP -RRB- amplitudes in normal ears and obtained the 95 % confidence interval -LRB- + / - 2 SD -RRB- for normal scatter around the fitted curve . Sixty-eight percent of SP amplitudes from ears with Meniere 's disease exceeded the upper normal confidence limit . In contrast , only 7 % of the cochlear ears and none of the retrocochlear ears had SP amplitudes above this normal upper limit . Cochlear microphonic potentials and APs from the ears with Meniere 's disease also tended to be larger than normal , but this tendency was not strong enough to be of diagnostic use . Visulization of endolymphatic hydrops has been reported using magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- in patients with Meniere 's disease . However , the relationship between the endolymphatic hydrops visualized by MRI and audio-vestibular functional tests have not been sufficiently investigated , such as pure tone audiometry -LRB- PTA -RRB- , electrocochleography -LRB- EcoG -RRB- , and vestibular evoked myogenic potential -LRB- VEMP -RRB- . Here we attempted to visualize endolymphatic hydrops in patients with Meniere 's disease using 3Tesla -LRB- 3T -RRB- - MRI following intratympanic gadolinium-diethylene-triamnie petaaetic acidbis -LRB- Gd-DTPA -RRB- injection and correlated the presence of hydrops with auditory testing . Following intratympanic Gd-DTPA contrast injections in 26 patients diagnosed as having definite Meniere 's disease , 3D-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery -LRB- 3D-FLAIR -RRB- sequence imagings were performed . The PTA , EcoG , and VEMP testing was done bilaterally . Patients had typical results of auditory testing for Meniere 's disease . The 3D-FLAIR MRI clearly demonstrated endolymphatic hydrops with signal voids in the cochlea -LRB- 81 % -RRB- and saccule -LRB- 69 % -RRB- in the definite Meniere 's disease group . Auditory tests verified that the visualized cochlear hydrops -LRB- basal turn -RRB- was correlated with a high tone hearing threshold in PTA and an abnormal EcoG . This study demonstrates that endolymphatic hydrops could be visualized by 3D-FLAIR MRI in Meniere 's disease patients . Cochlea hydrops and vestibular -LRB- saccular -RRB- hydrops are readily visualized using these techniques . Hydrops , as visualized on MRI , may be a reliable means to diagnosis Meniere 's disease ; this is supported by appropriate correlations with auditory vestibular functional testing . If a patient , who is lying supine and looking upward , is given bone-conducted vibration -LRB- BCV -RRB- of the forehead at the hairline in the midline -LRB- Fz -RRB- with a clinical reflex hammer or a powerful bone conduction vibrator , short-latency surface potentials called ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials -LRB- oVEMP -RRB- can be recorded from just beneath the eyes . The early negative -LRB- excitatory -RRB- component -LRB- n10 -RRB- is approximately equal in amplitude for both eyes in healthy subjects , but in patients with unilateral vestibular loss , the n10 component is significantly asymmetrical under the 2 eyes - the n10 component is small or absent under the eye on the side contralateral to the prior unilateral vestibular nerve removal , but of normal amplitude under the eye on the side contralateral to the healthy ear . The n10 component of the oVEMP response to BCV at Fz stimuli reflects vestibular and probably mainly otolithic function via crossed otolithic-ocular pathways , and so n10 asymmetry is a new way of identifying the affected side in patients with unilateral otolithic loss . Acoustic stimulation of the saccule gives rise to a vestibulocollic reflex , the output of which can be measured in the neck as inhibition of activity in the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle . This vestibular evoked myogenic potential has been promoted as a means of assessing integrity of saccular function . In this study , we test the hypothesis that the cochleosaccular hydrops of Ménière 's syndrome leads to alterations in saccular motion that change the dynamics of the vestibular evoked myogenic potential . Prospective cohort study . Large specialty hospital , department of otolaryngology . Fourteen normal adult volunteers and 34 consecutive consenting adult patients with unilateral Ménière 's disease by American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery diagnostic criteria . All subjects underwent vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing using ipsilateral broadband click and short tone-burst stimuli at 250 , 500 , 1,000 , 2,000 , and 4,000 Hz . Threshold , amplitude , and latency of vestibular evoked myogenic potential responses in normal and Ménière 's affected and unaffected ears . Vestibular evoked myogenic potential was present in all ears tested . Normal subjects show a frequency-dependent vestibular evoked myogenic potential threshold , with best response -LRB- `` frequency tuning '' -RRB- at 500 Hz . Compared with normal subjects and unaffected ears of Ménière 's subjects , affected Ménière 's ears had significantly increased vestibular evoked myogenic potential thresholds . Affected Ménière 's ears showed threshold shifts at all frequencies and there was less tuning apparent at 500 Hz . Unaffected ears of Ménière 's subjects also showed significantly elevated vestibular evoked myogenic potential thresholds compared with normal subjects . Analyses of vestibular evoked myogenic potential thresholds for effects of age , hearing loss , and audiometric configuration showed no significant differences . Ménière 's ears display alterations in vestibular evoked myogenic potential threshold and tuning , supporting our hypothesis of altered saccular motion mechanics arising from hydropic distention . Unaffected ears of unilateral Ménière 's subjects show similar changes , though to a lesser degree . This finding may be because of occult saccular hydrops in the asymptomatic ear or binaural interactions in the vestibular evoked myogenic potential otolith-cervical reflex arc . Ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials -LRB- oVEMP -RRB- in response to 250 - , 500 - and 1000-Hz air-conducted short tone bursts were studied in 22 healthy subjects and 37 Ménière 's disease patients . The goal of this study was to investigate normal tuning characteristics of the oVEMP and the possible oVEMP changes with respect to frequency dependence in Ménière 's disease . In unilateral Ménière 's disease patients , a distinction was made between affected ears and unaffected ears . It was found that in normal subjects , the oVEMP tunes to a stimulus frequency of 500 Hz , with the highest amplitude and lowest threshold at this particular frequency . Generally , Ménière 's disease patients showed lower amplitudes and higher thresholds than normal subjects at all 3 stimulus frequencies in both the affected and the unaffected ear . Additionally , for ears affected by Ménière 's disease , the best stimulus frequency was 1000 Hz . With the use of this altered tuning for these ears , we tried to find a criterion for distinguishing normal from Ménière 's disease ears . In this article , the present state of the art with respect to audiovestibular testing for Meniere 's disease -LRB- MD -RRB- is reviewed . There is no gold standard for MD diagnosis , and the classic dictum is that even the `` best '' tests yield positive results in only two-thirds of patients with MD. . Still , we advocate the use and further investigation of advanced audiovestibular testing in patients with MD in an attempt to answer the questions that confront any clinician who cares for patients with audiovestibular symptoms . Vestibular evoked myogenic potential -LRB- VEMP -RRB- testing has gained increased interest in the diagnosis of a variety of vestibular etiologies . P13/N23 latency , amplitude and threshold response curves have been used to compare pathologic groups to normal controls . Appropriate characterization of these etiologies requires normative data across the frequency spectrum and age range . The objective of the current study was to test the hypothesis that significant changes in VEMP responses occur as a function of increased age across all test stimuli as well as characterize the VEMP threshold response curve across age . This project incorporated a prospective study design using a sample of convenience . Openly recruited subjects were assigned to groups according to age . Forty-six normal controls ranging between 20 and 76 years of age participated in the study . Participants were separated by decade into five age categories from 20 to 60 plus years . Normal participants were characterized by having normal hearing sensitivity , no history of neurologic or balance/dizziness involvement , and negative results on a direct office vestibular examination . VEMP responses were measured at threshold to click and 250 , 500 , 750 , and 1000 Hz tone burst stimuli and at a suprathreshold level to 500 Hz toneburst stimuli at123 dB SPL . A mixed group factorial ANOVA -LRB- analysis of variance -RRB- and linear regression were performed to examine the effects of VEMP characteristics on age . There were no significant differences between ears for any of the test parameters . There were no significant differences between age groups for n23 latency or amplitude in response to any of the stimuli . Significant mean differences did exist between age groups for p13 latency -LRB- 250 , 750 , and 1000 Hz -RRB- and threshold -LRB- 500 and 750 Hz -RRB- . Age was significantly correlated with VEMP parameters . VEMP threshold was positively correlated -LRB- 250 , 500 , 750 , 1000 Hz -RRB- ; and amplitude was negatively correlated -LRB- 500 Hz maximum -RRB- . The threshold response curves revealed best frequency tuning at 500 Hz with the highest thresholds in response to click stimuli . However , this best frequency tuning dissipated with increased age . VEMP response rates also decreased with increased age . We have demonstrated that minor differences in VEMP responses occur with age . Given the reduced response rates and flattened frequency tuning curve for individuals over the age of 60 , frequency tuning curves may not be a good diagnostic indicator for this age group .	The function of the organ was followed by measuring its physiological response . The sensitivity of responsiveness in the RM group were significantly higher -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- , but not significantly greater -LRB- P = 0.03 -RRB- . The mean RM score -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- , and a mean difference were observed in the test group -LRB- mean difference , 0.43 , 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , P = 0.01 -RRB- . There was no significant differences between the two groups in terms of patients with enhanced respiratory impairment , but also significantly greater adverse effects of noise -LRB- 95 % CI , 0.67 to 0.99 -RRB- , respectively -LRB- d = .36 -RRB- , whereas no difference were found between groups in the group group -LRB- p = 0.001 -RRB- . Various 3 -RRB- Infrasound and low-frequency sound do not disturbed by exposure to low-frequency noise : Loudness judgments and equal sound-pressure level ; annoyance is exacerbated by rattle or other hand , it is also known , are `` blinded '' to the presence or absence of infrasound , and enhanced measurement techniques to evaluate the increased pressure of low-frequency noise than other noises of health bias and policy decisions , based on what is currently known to wind turbines noise . -LRB- 3 -RRB- Epidemiological studies have that the basilar membrane operating point may be disturbed by an endolymph volume change on hearing , and hearing protection are sometimes reported to be present unique health risks .
10	negative	conflict	At 6 months 	The purpose of the Correction of Myopia Evaluation Trial -LRB- COMET -RRB- was to evaluate the effect of progressive addition lenses -LRB- PALs -RRB- compared with single vision lenses -LRB- SVLs -RRB- on the progression of juvenile-onset myopia . COMET enrolled 469 children -LRB- ages 6-11 years -RRB- with myopia between -1.25 and -4.50 D spherical equivalent . The children were recruited at four colleges of optometry in the United States and were ethnically diverse . They were randomly assigned to receive either PALs with a +2.00 addition -LRB- n = 235 -RRB- or SVLs -LRB- n = 234 -RRB- , the conventional spectacle treatment for myopia , and were followed for 3 years . The primary outcome measure was progression of myopia , as determined by autorefraction after cycloplegia with 2 drops of 1 % tropicamide at each annual visit . The secondary outcome measure was change in axial length of the eyes , as assessed by A-scan ultrasonography . Child-based analyses -LRB- i.e. , the mean of the two eyes -RRB- were used . Results were adjusted for important covariates , by using multiple linear regression . Of the 469 children -LRB- mean age at baseline , 9.3 + / - 1.3 years -RRB- , 462 -LRB- 98.5 % -RRB- completed the 3-year visit . Mean -LRB- + / - SE -RRB- 3-year increases in myopia -LRB- spherical equivalent -RRB- were -1.28 + / - 0.06 D in the PAL group and -1.48 + / - 0.06 D in the SVL group . The 3-year difference in progression of 0.20 + / - 0.08 D between the two groups was statistically significant -LRB- P = 0.004 -RRB- . At 6 months , 17 % of the PAL group versus 30 % of the SVL group needed a prescription change -LRB- P = 0.0007 -RRB- , and , at 1 year , 43 % of the PAL group versus 59 % of the SVL group required a prescription change -LRB- P = 0.002 -RRB- . Interaction analyses identified a significantly larger treatment effect of PALs in children with lower versus higher baseline accommodative response at near -LRB- P = 0.03 -RRB- and with lower versus higher baseline myopia -LRB- P = 0.04 -RRB- . Mean -LRB- + / - SE -RRB- increases in the axial length of eyes of children in the PAL and SVL groups , respectively , were : 0.64 + / - 0.02 mm and 0.75 + / - 0.02 mm , with a statistically significant 3-year mean difference of 0.11 + / - 0.03 mm -LRB- P = 0.0002 -RRB- . Mean changes in axial length correlated with those in refractive error -LRB- r = 0.86 for PAL and 0.89 for SVL -RRB- . Use of PALs compared with SVLs slowed the progression of myopia in COMET children by a small , statistically significant amount only during the first year . The size of the treatment effect remained similar and significant for the next 2 years . The results provide some support for the COMET rationale-that is , a role for defocus in progression of myopia . The small magnitude of the effect does not warrant a change in clinical practice . To examine associations between myopia and measures of urbanization in a population-based sample of 12-year-old Australian children . Questionnaire data on sociodemographic and environmental factors including ethnicity , parental education , and time spent in near work and outdoor activities were collected from 2367 children -LRB- 75.0 % response -RRB- and their parents . Population density data for the Sydney area were used to construct five urban regions . Myopia was defined as spherical equivalent refraction < / = -0.50 D. Myopia prevalence was lowest in the outer suburban region -LRB- 6.9 % -RRB- and highest in the inner city region -LRB- 17.8 % -RRB- , with mean refraction tending toward greater myopia by region -LRB- outer suburban to inner city -RRB- , after adjustment for age , sex , ethnicity , near work , outdoor activity , and parental myopia . Multivariate-adjusted analyses confirmed greater odds for myopia in regions of higher population density -LRB- P -LRB- trend -RRB- = 0.0001 -RRB- . Myopia was significantly more prevalent among children living in apartment residences than other housing types -LRB- chi -LRB- 2 -RRB- < 0.0001 -RRB- , after adjustment for ethnicity , near work , and outdoor activity . Housing density -LRB- measured as the number of houses visible from a front door -RRB- was not significantly associated with myopia -LRB- chi -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 0.1 -RRB- . For both European Caucasian and East Asian children , myopia was most prevalent in the inner city region -LRB- 8.1 % and 55.1 % , for European Caucasian and East Asian , respectively -RRB- . The higher myopia prevalence in inner city-urban areas compared with outer suburban areas for this large childhood sample suggest that even moderate environmental differences within a predominantly urban setting may be associated with increased odds of myopia . These findings are consistent with previous reports of rural-urban differences in childhood myopia . To estimate the societal economic burden and the governmental budgetary impact of the following visual disorders among US adults aged 40 years and older : visual impairment , blindness , refractive error , age-related macular degeneration , cataracts , diabetic retinopathy , and primary open-angle glaucoma . We estimated 3 components of economic burden : direct medical costs , other direct costs , and productivity losses . We used private insurance and Medicare claims data to estimate direct medical costs ; epidemiologic evidence from multiple published sources to estimate other direct costs , such as nursing home costs ; and data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to estimate productivity losses . We used budgetary documents and our direct medical and other direct cost estimates to approximate the governmental budgetary impact . We estimated that the annual total financial burden of major adult visual disorders is $ 35.4 billion -LRB- $ 16.2 billion in direct medical costs , $ 11.1 billion in other direct costs , and $ 8 billion in productivity losses -RRB- and that the annual governmental budgetary impact is $ 13.7 billion . Major visual disorders among Americans older than 40 years result in substantial economic costs for the US economy . Well-designed public health programs may have the ability to reduce this burden in the future . Besides the direct economic and social burden of myopia , associated ocular complications may lead to substantial visual loss . In several population and clinic-based cohorts , case-control and cross-sectional studies , higher risks of posterior subcapsular cataract , cortical and nuclear cataract in myopic patients were reported . Patients with high myopia -LRB- spherical equivalent at least -6.0 D -RRB- are more susceptible to ocular abnormalities . The prevalent risks of glaucoma were higher in myopic adults , and risks of chorioretinal abnormalities such as retinal detachment , chorioretinal atrophy and lacquer cracks increased with severity of myopia and greater axial length . Myopic adults were more likely to have tilted , rotated , and larger discs as well as other optic disc abnormalities . Often , these studies support possible associations between myopia and specific ocular complications , but we can not infer causality because of limitations in study methodology . The detection and treatment of possible pathological ocular complications is essential in the management of high myopia . The ocular risks associated with myopia should not be underestimated and there is a public health need to prevent the onset or progression of myopia . To compare US population prevalence estimates for myopia in 1971-1972 and 1999-2004 . The 1971-1972 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided the earliest nationally representative estimates for US myopia prevalence ; myopia was diagnosed by an algorithm using either lensometry , pinhole visual acuity , and presenting visual acuity -LRB- for presenting visual acuity > or = 20/40 -RRB- or retinoscopy -LRB- for presenting visual acuity < or = 20/50 -RRB- . Using a similar method for diagnosing myopia , we examined data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to determine whether myopia prevalence had changed during the 30 years between the 2 surveys . Using the 1971-1972 method , the estimated prevalence of myopia in persons aged 12 to 54 years was significantly higher in 1999-2004 than in 1971-1972 -LRB- 41.6 % vs 25.0 % , respectively ; P < .001 -RRB- . Prevalence estimates were higher in 1999-2004 than in 1971-1972 for black individuals -LRB- 33.5 % vs 13.0 % , respectively ; P < .001 -RRB- and white individuals -LRB- 43.0 % vs 26.3 % , respectively ; P < .001 -RRB- and for all levels of myopia severity -LRB- > -2.0 diopters -LSB- D -RSB- : 17.5 % vs 13.4 % , respectively -LSB- P < .001 -RSB- ; < or = -2.0 to > -7.9 D : 22.4 % vs 11.4 % , respectively -LSB- P < .001 -RSB- ; < or = -7.9 D : 1.6 % vs 0.2 % , respectively -LSB- P < .001 -RSB- -RRB- . When using similar methods for each period , the prevalence of myopia in the United States appears to be substantially higher in 1999-2004 than 30 years earlier . Identifying modifiable risk factors for myopia could lead to the development of cost-effective interventional strategies .	The 3-year difference in progression of 0.20 + / - 0.08 D between the two groups was statistically significant -LRB- P = 0.004 -RRB- , with mean refraction tending toward greater myopia by age , sex , ethnicity , near work , outdoor activity , and parental myopia . At 6 months , the SVL group -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , and the axial length of eyes was significantly higher in the SVL group

In the present study , we reviewed our initial experience with nesiritide in children with primary heart failure or low cardiac output after heart surgery . Nesiritide was administered in an open-label fashion to patients with heart failure who were already receiving inotropic and diuretic therapy . Between July 2003 and August 2004 , 30 patients aged 5 days to 16.7 yrs -LRB- median age , 4.6 months -RRB- received nesiritide therapy . Diagnoses included single-ventricle congenital defect -LRB- n = 5 -RRB- , two-ventricle congenital defect -LRB- n = 13 -RRB- , heart transplant -LRB- n = 5 -RRB- , and dilated cardiomyopathy -LRB- n = 7 -RRB- . Sixteen patients were started on nesiritide within 2 wks of corrective or palliative heart surgery . The majority of subjects -LRB- n = 24 -RRB- received an initial bolus dose .

12	positive	none	none	none	Past studies have reported impairments in children with early-treated phenylketonuria -LRB- PKU -RRB- in executive abilities such as strategic processing and working memory . Findings have been inconsistent in terms of the integrity of inhibitory control , another executive ability . This study administered 4 inhibitory tasks -LRB- flanker , Stroop , go/no-go , antisaccade -RRB- to 26 children with PKU and 25 typically developing control children . Children with PKU performed more poorly than typically developing children on the 2 inhibitory tasks with the strongest experimental manipulations -LRB- go/no-go and antisaccade -RRB- between control and inhibitory conditions . Findings suggest that the inhibitory deficit associated with PKU is subtle and that inconsistent findings in past studies may be largely due to the insensitivity of experimental manipulations in some tasks . The prefrontal cortex of the brain has been shown to play a crucial role in working memory , and age-related changes in prefrontal function may contribute to the improvements in working memory that are observed during childhood . We examined the developmental trajectory of working memory in school-age children with early-treated phenylketonuria -LRB- PKU -RRB- , a metabolic disorder that results in prefrontal dysfunction . Using a recognition procedure , we evaluated working memory for letters , abstract objects , and spatial locations in 20 children with PKU and 20 typically developing control children . Children in both groups ranged from 6 to 17 years of age . Our findings revealed poorer performance across all three types of materials for children with PKU . In addition , there was a significant difference in the developmental trajectory of working memory for children with PKU as compared with controls . Specifically , deficits were not apparent in younger children with PKU . Instead , deficits were observed only in older children , suggesting the presence of a developmental deficit rather than a developmental delay in the working memory of children with PKU . The prefrontal cortex has been implicated in the mediation of executive processes that facilitate learning and memory . The authors hypothesized that children with prefrontal dysfunction related to phenylketonuria -LRB- PKU -RRB- would experience deficits in learning and memory because of impaired strategy use . Children with PKU , especially older children , showed poorer learning across trials and less use of semantic clustering on the CVLT-C but intact retention of previously encoded information . With the exception of phonemic fluency , deficits were not observed in general executive control . Results are discussed within the context of abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex and white matter of the brain .

13	positive	none	none	none	To provide a single source for the best available estimates of the national prevalence of arthritis in general and of selected musculoskeletal disorders -LRB- osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , the spondylarthropathies , systemic lupus erythematosus , scleroderma , polymyalgia rheumatica/giant cell arteritis , gout , fibromyalgia , and low back pain -RRB- . The National Arthritis Data Workgroup reviewed data from available surveys , such as the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey series . For overall national estimates , we used surveys based on representative samples . Because data based on national population samples are unavailable for most specific musculoskeletal conditions , we derived data from various smaller survey samples from defined populations . Prevalence estimates from these surveys were linked to 1990 US Bureau of the Census population data to calculate national estimates . We also estimated the expected frequency of arthritis in the year 2020 . Current national estimates are provided , with important caveats regarding their interpretation , for self-reported arthritis and selected conditions . An estimated 15 % -LRB- 40 million -RRB- of Americans had some form of arthritis in 1995 . By the year 2020 , an estimated 18.2 % -LRB- 59.4 million -RRB- will be affected . Given the limitations of the data on which they are based , this report provides the best available prevalence estimates for arthritis and other rheumatic conditions overall , and for selected musculoskeletal disorders , in the US population . The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence and pattern of radiographic changes of osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- of the knee by age and gender in Caucasian participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging . Bilateral standing weight-bearing radiographs of the knee in 547 male and 351 female subjects -LRB- aged 20 and above -RRB- were read for changes of knee OA using Kellgren-Lawrence and individual features scales . Prevalence of definite -LRB- Kellgren-Lawrence grade > or = 2 changes -RRB- knee OA increased with advancing age in both sexes . Approximately 50 percent in both sexes showed bilateral involvement . Men aged 59 and below were more likely to have unilateral impairment than men aged 60 and above ; no such differences were found in females . These data demonstrate that age and gender influence both the prevalence and pattern of radiographic changes of knee OA . We report the results of a population based analysis of all health services used and charges incurred over a one-year period among a community based cohort of persons with a diagnosis of arthritis -LSB- including both osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- and rheumatoid arthritis -LRB- RA -RRB- -RSB- compared to a similar cohort of individuals from the same community who have never had a diagnosis of arthritis -LRB- NA -RRB- , to examine the attributable costs of this chronic condition . The unique resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project were used to assemble the arthritis prevalence cohorts and the population based control cohort . The Olmsted County Health Care Utilization and Expenditures Database was used to collect information on health services utilization and charges . The average direct medical charges for the RA , OA , and NA cohorts were $ 3,802.05 , $ 2,654.51 , and $ 1,387.83 , respectively -LRB- age and sex adjusted , p < 0.0001 for both the RA vs NA and OA vs NA comparisons -RRB- . The median charges for these 3 groups were $ 1,050.00 , $ 663.55 , and $ 232.04 for the RA , OA , and NA groups , respectively -LRB- age and sex adjusted p < 0.0001 for both the RA vs NA and OA vs NA comparisons -RRB- . These analyses indicated that , compared to the NA cohort both the OA and the RA prevalence cohorts incurred statistically significantly more charges , not only for the musculoskeletal disease care , but also for the care of numerous other conditions including respiratory , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , neurological , and psychiatric conditions ; and for general medical care . Individuals with arthritis -LRB- both OA and RA -RRB- also incurred statistically significantly more charges for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures , in-hospital care , imaging studies , physician services , equipment , and laboratory studies . Use of prescription medications was statistically significantly more common in the RA and OA groups compared to NA -LRB- 96.3 , 96 , and 83 % , respectively ; age and sex adjusted p = 0.006 for the OA vs NA comparison and p = 0.015 for RA vs NA -RRB- . These results emphasize the importance of considering all health services utilization -LRB- rather than only disease specific use -RRB- when estimating the economic effect of a chronic illness such as arthritis . To investigate the clinical efficacy of the Generation II -LRB- G II -RRB- knee brace , a newly developed knee orthosis , on patients experiencing severe medial compartment osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- of the knee . Case series . A national medical and pharmaceutical hospital in Japan . Twenty primary OA subjects -LRB- excluding those with secondary OA -RRB- , all older than 55 years of age and experiencing only knee joint problems , were selected according to their ability to walk more than 500 meters independent of support . These patients had arthritis in both knees and no less than one half of normal joint space remaining as revealed by roentgenogram studies . The more severely affected side was selected for bracing . For 12 months , each patient wore a G II knee brace on the affected knee on a daily basis , removing it only at night . To evaluate the effects of G II OA brace alone , additional use of new oral drugs or any other treatment was prohibited from 1 month before application of the G II OA brace and throughout the trial period . Clinical efficacy was evaluated using the Japan Orthopaedic Association 's knee scoring system . X-ray evaluation was performed with patients standing on one leg . A dynamometer was used to evaluate isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength . The center of gravity was measured using an X-Y recording . Clinical evaluation was performed every 2 months thereafter . Final evaluation was at 12 months . Nineteen of the 20 patients answered that they experienced significant pain relief . Knee pain scores on walking increased from 18.0 to 21.5 and on ascending and descending stairs increased from 12.8 to 15.8 . The femorotibial angle decreased in 12 of the patients , and the mean angle decreased from 185.1 degrees before application to 183.7 degrees with the brace on at the final observation period . In addition , isokinetic quadriceps muscle strength increased from an average of 36.8 Nm to 42.8 Nm for all patients . In 17 patients , quadriceps muscle strength increased , while it decreased in 2 and remained the same in 1 . Finally , lateral movement of the center of gravity decreased compared with before G II application in all patients . G II bracing is a beneficial treatment for severe medial OA of the knee . The purpose of this study was to compare a custom-made valgus-producing functional knee -LRB- unloader -RRB- brace , a neoprene sleeve , and medical treatment only -LRB- control group -RRB- with regard to their ability to improve the disease-specific quality of life and the functional status of patients who had osteoarthritis in association with a varus deformity of the knee -LRB- varus gonarthrosis -RRB- . The study design was a prospective , parallel-group , randomized clinical trial . Patients who had varus gonarthrosis were screened for eligibility . The criteria for exclusion included arthritides other than osteoarthritis ; an operation on the knee within the previous six months ; symptomatic disease of the hip , ankle , or foot ; a previous fracture of the tibia or femur ; morbid obesity -LRB- a body-mass index of more than thirty-five kilograms per square meter -RRB- ; skin disease ; peripheral vascular disease or varicose veins that would preclude use of a brace ; a severe cardiovascular deficit ; blindness ; poor English-language skills ; and an inability to apply a brace because of physical limitations such as arthritis in the hand or an inability to bend over . Treatment was assigned on the basis of a computer-generated block method of randomization with use of sealed envelopes . The patients were stratified according to age -LRB- less than fifty years or at least fifty years -RRB- , deformity -LRB- the mechanical axis in less than 5 degrees of varus or in at least 5 degrees of varus -RRB- , and the status of the anterior cruciate ligament -LRB- torn or intact -RRB- . The patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups : medical treatment only -LRB- control group -RRB- , medical treatment and use of a neoprene sleeve , or medical treatment and use of an unloader brace . The disease-specific quality of life was measured with use of the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index -LRB- WOMAC -RRB- and the McMaster-Toronto Arthritis Patient Preference Disability Questionnaire -LRB- MACTAR -RRB- , and function was assessed with use of the six-minute walking and thirty-second stair-climbing tests . The primary outcome measure consisted of an analysis of covariance of the change in scores between the baseline and six-month evaluations . One hundred and nineteen patients were randomized . The control group consisted of forty patients -LRB- thirty-one men and nine women ; mean age , 60.9 years -RRB- ; the neoprene-sleeve group , of thirty-eight patients -LRB- twenty-seven men and eleven women ; mean age , 58.2 years -RRB- ; and the unloader-brace group , of forty-one patients -LRB- twenty-eight men and thirteen women ; mean age , 59.5 years -RRB- . Nine patients withdrew from the study . There was a strong trend toward a significant difference between the unloader-brace group and the neoprene-sleeve group with regard to the change in the WOMAC aggregate -LRB- p = 0.062 -RRB- and WOMAC physical function scores -LRB- p = 0.081 -RRB- . The results indicate that patients who have varus gonarthrosis may benefit significantly from use of a knee brace in addition to standard medical treatment . The unloader brace was , on the average , more effective than the neoprene sleeve . The ideal candidates for each of these bracing options remain to be identified . We assessed the clinical knee score and bone mineral density of the proximal tibia in an attempt to evaluate the efficacy of valgus knee bracing . The knee score improved after 3 months , and increases in bone mineral density were seen more in the lateral tibial condyle than in the medial . These results suggest that the brace acts by transferring the forces across the knee joint from the medial to the lateral side . Objectives in treating primarily unicompartmental knee arthritis with a load-shifting brace are pain relief , compliance , brace durability , and complication-free treatment over multiple years . This was a single institution retrospective chart review , radiograph review , and telephone survey of patients treated from 1997 to 1999 with a load-shifting knee brace . Forty-six patients -LRB- 49 knees -RRB- with a minimum 2 1/2 - year follow-up -LRB- average 3.3 years -RRB- were reviewed . Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis revealed that load-shifting brace use had a survival of 76 % at 1 year , 69 % at 2 years , and 61 % at 3 years . Younger patients had a higher likelihood of longer brace use than older patients . One patient had ipsilateral leg swelling and a pulmonary embolus after initiating bracing . Eliminating the high numbers of early failures would be desirable . One should be aware of the potential complication of venous thrombosis and thromboembolism . The use of a valgus brace can effectively relieve the symptoms of unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee . This study provides an objective measurement of function by analysis of gait symmetry . This was measured in 30 patients on four separate occasions : immediately before and after initial fitting and then again at three months with the brace on and off . All patients reported immediate symptomatic improvement with less pain on walking . After fitting the brace , symmetry indices of stance and the swing phase of gait showed a consistent and immediate improvement at 0 and 3 months , respectively , of 3.92 % -LRB- p = 0.030 -RRB- and 3.40 % -LRB- p = 0.025 -RRB- in the stance phase and 11.78 % -LRB- p = 0.020 -RRB- and 9.58 % -LRB- p = 0.005 -RRB- in the swing phase . This was confirmed by a significant improvement at three months in the mean Hospital for Special Surgery -LRB- HSS -RRB- knee score from 69.9 to 82.0 -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- . Thus , wearing a valgus brace gives a significant and immediate improvement in the function of patients with unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the knee , as measured by analysis of gait symmetry .	These results emphasize the importance of considering all health services utilization -LRB- rather than only disease specific use -RRB- when estimating the economic effect of a chronic illness such as arthritis . The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of the RA of RA , and the prevalence of osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- , and rheumatoid arthritis -LRB- RA -RRB- , which may be important for the clinical efficacy of RA . Use of osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , and RA were also associated with RA . The median charges for these 3 groups were statistically significantly more common in the RA group -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- . Use of prescription medications was statistically significantly more
14	negative	conflict	N = 107	N = 115	Transarterial chemoembolization -LRB- TACE -RRB- is considered the gold standard for treating intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma -LRB- HCC -RRB- . However , intermediate-stage HCC includes a heterogeneous population of patients with varying tumour burdens , liver function -LRB- Child-Pugh A or B -RRB- and disease aetiology . This suggests that not all patients with intermediate-stage HCC will derive similar benefit from TACE , and that some patients may benefit from other treatment options . Results of an extensive literature review into the treatment of unresectable HCC with TACE were combined with our own clinical experience to identify factors that may predict survival after TACE . We also report contraindications to TACE and propose a treatment algorithm for the repetition of TACE . In addition , we have constructed a number of expert opinions that may be used as a guide to help physicians make treatment decisions for their patients with intermediate-stage HCC . The data included in the literature review related almost exclusively to conventional TACE , rather than to TACE with drug-eluting beads . By distinguishing those patients who represent good candidates for TACE from those where little or no benefit might be expected , it may be possible to make better use of current treatment options and improve outcomes for patients . The intermediate stage of hepatocellular carcinoma -LRB- HCC -RRB- comprises a highly heterogeneous patient population and therefore poses unique challenges for therapeutic management , different from the early and advanced stages . Patients classified as having intermediate HCC by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer -LRB- BCLC -RRB- staging system present with varying tumor burden and liver function . Transarterial chemoembolization -LRB- TACE -RRB- is currently recommended as the standard of care in this setting , but there is considerable variation in the clinical benefit patients derive from this treatment.In April 2012 , a panel of experts convened to discuss unresolved issues surrounding the application of current guidelines when managing patients with intermediate HCC . The meeting explored the applicability of a subclassification system for intermediate HCC patients to tailor therapeutic interventions based on the evidence available to date and expert opinion . The present report summarizes the proposal of the expert panel : four substages of intermediate HCC patients , B1 to B4 . Hepatocellular carcinoma -LRB- HCC -RRB- presents with a high burden of disease in East Asian countries . Intermediate-stage HCC as defined by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer -LRB- BCLC -RRB- staging system poses a clinical challenge as it includes a heterogeneous population of patients that can vary widely in terms of tumour burden , liver function and disease aetiology . Intermediate HCC patients often have unsatisfactory clinical outcomes with repeated transarterial chemoembolization -LRB- TACE , due to non-response of the target tumour or the development of further metastasis indicating progressive disease . In September 2011 , an Expert Panel Opinion on Interventions in Hepatocellular Carcinoma -LRB- EPOIHCC -RRB- was convened in HK in an attempt to provide a consensus on the practice of TACE . To that end , current clinical practice throughout Asia was reviewed in detail including safety and efficacy data on TACE alone as well as in combination with targeted systemic therapies . This review summarises the evidence discussed at the meeting and provides expert recommendation regarding the available therapeutic options for unresectable intermediate stage HCC . A key consensus of the Expert Panel was that in order to improve patient outcomes and long-term survival , the possibility of using TACE in combination with targeted agents given systemically should be explored . While the currently available clinical data is promising , the expected completion of several pivotal phase II and III RCTs will provide further evidence in support of the rationale for combination therapy regimens . We aimed to establish an objective point score to guide the decision for retreatment with transarterial chemoembolization -LRB- TACE -RRB- in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma -LRB- HCC -RRB- . In all , 222 patients diagnosed with HCC and treated with multiple TACE cycles between January 1999 and December 2009 at the Departments of Gastroenterology/Hepatology of the Medical Universities of Vienna -LRB- training cohort -RRB- and Innsbruck -LRB- validation cohort -RRB- were included . We investigated the effect of the first TACE on parameters of liver function and tumor response and their impact on overall survival -LRB- OS , log rank test -RRB- and developed a point score -LRB- ART score : Assessment for Retreatment with TACE -RRB- in the training cohort -LRB- n = 107 , Vienna -RRB- by using a stepwise Cox regression model . The ART score was externally validated in an independent validation cohort -LRB- n = 115 , Innsbruck -RRB- . The increase of aspartate aminotransferase -LRB- AST -RRB- by > 25 % -LRB- hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- 8.4 ; P < 0.001 -RRB- , an increase of Child-Pugh score of 1 -LRB- HR 2.0 -RRB- or ≥ 2 points -LRB- HR 4.4 -RRB- -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- from baseline , and the absence of radiologic tumor response -LRB- HR 1.7 ; P = 0.026 -RRB- remained independent negative prognostic factors for OS and were used to create the ART score . The ART score differentiated two groups -LRB- 0-1.5 points ; ≥ 2.5 points -RRB- with distinct prognosis -LRB- median OS : 23.7 versus 6.6 months ; P < 0.001 -RRB- and a higher ART score was associated with major adverse events after the second TACE -LRB- P = 0.011 -RRB- . These results were confirmed in the external validation cohort and remained significant irrespective of Child-Pugh stage and the presence of ascites prior the second TACE . An ART score of ≥ 2.5 prior the second TACE identifies patients with a dismal prognosis who may not profit from further TACE sessions . -LRB- HEPATOLOGY 2013 ; 57:2261-2273 -RRB- . Recently , we developed the ART score -LRB- assessment for re-treatment with TACE -RRB- to guide the decision for a second transarterial chemoembolization -LRB- TACE-2 -RRB- in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma -LRB- HCC -RRB- . Patients with an ART score of 0-1.5 points gained benefit from a second TACE session , while patients with an ART score ≥ 2.5 points did not . Here , we investigated -LRB- 1 -RRB- the prognostic significance of the ART score prior to the third -LRB- TACE-3 -RRB- and fourth TACE -LRB- TACE-4 -RRB- , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the feasibility of an ART score guided re-treatment strategy by sequential assessment of the ART score in HCC patients treated with multiple TACE sessions . 109 patients , diagnosed with intermediate stage HCC and treated with ≥ 3 TACE sessions between January 1999 and December 2009 at the Medical Universities of Vienna and Innsbruck , were included . The ART score prior to each TACE session was assessed in comparison to the TACE naïve liver . The prognostic performance of the ART score before TACE-3 and 4 was evaluated with and without stratification based on the ART score prior to the respective last intervention . The pre-TACE-3 ART score discriminated two groups with different prognosis and remained a valid predictor of OS independent of Child-Pugh score -LRB- 5-7 points -RRB- , CRP-levels and tumor characteristics . Even in patients with an initially beneficial ART score -LRB- 0-1.5 points -RRB- before TACE-2 , repeated ART score assessment before TACE-3 identified a subgroup of patients with dismal prognosis -LRB- median OS : 27.8 vs. 10.8 months , p < 0.001 -RRB- . Similar results were observed when the ART score was applied before TACE-4 . The sequential assessment of the ART score identifies patients with dismal prognosis prior to each TACE session .	The ART score was externally validated in an independent validation cohort -LRB- n = 115 , Innsbruck -RRB- . There were no significant differences between the ART groups , but there was a significant reduction in the ART group -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , and the absence of radiologic adverse events -LRB- P = 0.011 -RRB- , whereas the mean HR -LRB- HR 4.4 , 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , respectively -RRB- , but not statistically significant differences in Child-Pugh score in the second tumour group -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- . The ART of HK was significantly higher in patients with targeted agents given by the ART of the ART score of the second TACE -LRB- P =
15	positive	none	none	none	Fecal microbiota transplantation -LRB- FMT -RRB- has attracted great interest in recent years , largely due to the global Clostridium difficile infection -LRB- CDI -RRB- epidemic and major advances in metagenomic sequencing of the gastrointestinal -LRB- GI -RRB- microbiota , with growing understanding of its structure and function . FMT is now recommended as the most effective therapy for relapsing CDI and , with further refinement , may even be used in `` first-time '' CDI . There is interest also in other conditions related to GI dysbiosis -- for example , inflammatory bowel disease , irritable bowel syndrome , obesity , and diabetes mellitus -- although quality evidence is at present lacking . A few trials are now underway in FMT for ulcerative colitis . Many unanswered questions remain , including FMT methodology -- for example , optimal route of administration , what makes a `` good donor , '' safety issues , and long-term effects of FMT . Parkinson 's disease is associated with gastrointestinal motility abnormalities favoring the occurrence of local infections . The aim of this study was to investigate whether small intestinal bacterial overgrowth contributes to the pathophysiology of motor fluctuations . Thirty-three patients and 30 controls underwent glucose , lactulose , and urea breath tests to detect small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and Helicobacter pylori infection . Patients also underwent ultrasonography to evaluate gastric emptying . The clinical status and plasma concentration of levodopa were assessed after an acute drug challenge with a standard dose of levodopa , and motor complications were assessed by Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale-IV and by 1-week diaries of motor conditions . Patients with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth were treated with rifaximin and were clinically and instrumentally reevaluated 1 and 6 months later . Compared with patients without any infection , the prevalence of unpredictable fluctuations was significantly higher in patients with both infections -LRB- 8.3 % vs. 87.5 % ; P = .008 -RRB- . Gastric half-emptying time was significantly longer in patients than in healthy controls but did not differ in patients based on their infective status . Compared with patients without isolated small intestinal bacterial overgrowth , patients with isolated small intestinal bacterial overgrowth had longer off time daily and more episodes of delayed-on and no-on . The eradication of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth resulted in improvement in motor fluctuations without affecting the pharmacokinetics of levodopa . © 2013 Movement Disorder Society . The goal of the present study was to clarify the clinical characteristics and laboratory results of parkinsonian symptoms among patients with and without camptocormia . Seventy-eight Parkinson 's disease -LRB- PD -RRB- patients with camptocormia and 78 PD patients without camptocormia underwent a neurological examination , a blood test , and spinal magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- . PD with camptocormia group and PD with non-camptocormia group were matched on age , age at PD onset , and sex . Camptocormia group had significantly higher prevalence of compression fractures , more severe parkinsonian symptoms , and a greater incidence of dementia than those without camptocormia . Serum creatine kinase levels in camptocormia group significantly elevated compared with non-camptocormia group . There were higher prevalence of abnormal findings in spine MRI including compression fractures and paravertebral muscle changes in camptocormia group compared with non-camptocormia group . Camptocormia is associated with a greater prevalence of compression fractures and associated with greater UPDRS part II , part III score , axial score , and lower MMSE in this cross-sectional study .	Seventy-eight Parkinson 's disease -LRB- PD -RRB- patients with camptocormia and 78 PD patients without camptocormia underwent a neurological examination , a blood test , obesity , and diabetes mellitus -- although quality evidence is at present lacking . The eradication of compression fractures was significantly higher in patients with both infections -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- . Thirty-three patients had a greater reduction in compression than those with any infection . Compared with patients without isolated small intestinal bacterial overgrowth , and urea breath tests to detect small intestinal overgrowth had longer off time daily and more episodes of delayed-on and by 1-week diaries of motor conditions . There is interest also in other conditions related to GI dysbiosis -- for example , inflammatory bowel disease and CDI in this cross-sectional study . There were higher prevalence of abnormal findings in spine MRI including unpredictable with further refinement , may even be used in `` infective status , and spinal magnetic resonance imaging -LRB- MRI -RRB- .

16	positive	none	none	none	The authors tested the effect of agency assignment and agentic images on young adults ' -LRB- N = 246 -RRB- reactions to educational materials about H1N1 influenza . The authors hypothesized that assigning agency to the virus would heighten perceived severity and personal susceptibility relative to human agency assignment . Results were consistent with this hypothesis , indicating that virus agency increased perceptions of severity , personal susceptibility , and reported intentions to seek vaccination relative to human agency . The image manipulation did not directly affect these factors . The findings suggest that strategic agency assignment can improve the effectiveness of educational materials about influenza and other health threats . To examine the impact of different presentations of equivalent information -LRB- framing -RRB- on treatment decisions faced by patients . A systematic review of the published literature was conducted . English language publications allocating participants to different frames were retrieved using electronic and bibliographic searches . Two reviewers examined each article for inclusion , and assessed methodological quality . Study characteristics were tabulated and where possible , relative risks -LRB- RR ; 95 % confidence intervals -RRB- were calculated to estimate intervention effects . Thirty-seven articles , yielding 40 experimental studies , were included . Studies examined treatment -LRB- N = 24 -RRB- , immunization -LRB- N = 5 -RRB- , or health behavior scenarios -LRB- N = 11 -RRB- . Overall , active treatments were preferred when outcomes were described in terms of relative rather than absolute risk reductions or number needed to treat . Surgery was preferred to other treatments when treatment efficacy was presented in a positive frame -LRB- survival -RRB- rather than a negative frame -LRB- mortality -RRB- -LRB- relative risk -LSB- RR -RSB- = 1.51 , 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , 1.39 to 1.64 -RRB- . Framing effects were less obvious for immunization and health behavior scenarios . Those with little interest in the behavior at baseline were influenced by framing , particularly when information was presented as gains . In studies judged to be of good methodological quality and/or examining actual decisions , the framing effect , although still evident , was less convincing compared to the results of all included studies . The aim of this review was to identify factors predicting actual or intended adherence to antivirals as treatment or prophylaxis for influenza . Literature from inception to March 2015 was systematically reviewed to find studies reporting predictors of adherence to antivirals and self-reported reasons for non-adherence to antivirals . Twenty-six studies were included in the review ; twenty identified through the literature search and six through other means . Of these studies , 18 assessed predictors of actual adherence to antivirals , whereas eight assessed predictors of intended adherence . The most commonly found predictor of , and self-reported reason for , non-adherence was the occurrence of side effects . Other predictors include perceptions surrounding self-efficacy , response efficacy and perceived personal consequences as well as social influences of others ' experiences of taking antivirals . Predictors identified in this review can be used to help inform communications to increase adherence to antivirals in both seasonal and pandemic influenza .

17	negative	conflict	Vaginal douching and bacterial vaginosis were not associated with spontaneous preterm birth overall	Vaginal douching was not associated with a significant reduction in the prevalence of BV 	This study aimed to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis -LRB- BV -RRB- and other cervicovaginal infections , as well as the incidence of complications among new users of IUD , 1 and 6 months after its insertion , in the City of Campinas , Brazil . A total of 223 women who had a TCu-380A IUD inserted from May through November 2001 , were included in the study . After the IUD insertion all women were scheduled to two additional visits : after 1 month and after 6 months , when they were interviewed and a pelvic examination was performed , along with a collection of specimens from the vagina and the endocervix for laboratory testing . The Nugent 's criterion was used for the BV diagnosis . They were also evaluated with regard to presence of complications possibly related to IUD insertion and use , i.e. , abnormal bleeding , dysmenorrhea , expulsion and pelvic inflammatory disease . The prevalence of cervicovaginal infections was 29.1 % , BV being the most frequent -LRB- 19.7 % -RRB- . A trend of abnormal bleeding being more frequent among women with BV was also found . In conclusion , BV after 1 month of IUD insertion was not associated with IUD complications , with the exception of dysmenorrhea . To evaluate the relationship between douching and bacterial vaginosis -LRB- BV -RRB- among women with and without prior abnormal vaginal flora . 1193 women had vaginal swabs obtained for Gram stain for BV , culture for vaginal microflora , and DNA amplification for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis at baseline and 6 , 12 , 24 , and 36 months . Self-reported douching was queried every 6 months . In cross-sectional analyses , douching at least once per month was associated with BV among women who had BV at the immediately preceding visit but not among women with normal or intermediate flora . In prospective analyses , douching increased the risk of acquisition for BV among women with intermediate flora -LRB- adj. HR 1.5 , 95 % CI 1.1-2.4 -RRB- but not among women with normal flora . Douching appeared to be associated with BV among women with already imbalanced flora but not among women with normal flora . Vaginal douching and bacterial vaginosis -LRB- BV -RRB- are independently associated with spontaneous preterm birth . Because the interrelationships among these variables remain unclear , we sought to examine the associations in a prospective study . We conducted a nested case-control study within a prospectively recruited cohort of pregnant women . We prospectively collected demographic and health status data , data on pre-pregnancy vaginal douching , vaginal smears for bacterial vaginosis as defined by Nugent 's criteria , fetal fibronectin at 26 weeks of pregnancy , and placental pathology at delivery . Spontaneous preterm births before 37 weeks ' gestation were selected as cases . All spontaneous births occurring after 37 weeks were potential control subjects . To limit costs , some tests were performed only in selected control subjects . Preterm birth occurred in 207 of 5092 women -LRB- 4.1 % -RRB- . In bivariate analysis , BV was not associated with preterm birth -LRB- OR 1.2 ; 95 % CI 0.5 to 2.4 -RRB- . Vaginal douching was significantly associated with bacterial vaginosis -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- and preterm birth -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- . Vaginal douching and bacterial vaginosis were not associated with spontaneous preterm birth overall . However , vaginal douching appears to be an independent and potentially modifiable risk factor for early preterm birth -LRB- 32-34 weeks -RRB- , although the mechanism remains unclear . To assess the association between vaginal douching and sexually transmitted infections -LRB- STI -RRB- among a group of female sex workers -LRB- FSWs -RRB- in Nairobi , Kenya . This study was part of a randomised , placebo controlled trial of monthly prophylaxis with 1 g of azithromycin to prevent STIs and HIV infection in a cohort of Nairobi FSWs . Consenting women were administered a questionnaire and screened for STIs . The seroprevalence of HIV-1 among 543 FSWs screened was 30 % . HIV infection was significantly associated with bacterial vaginosis -LRB- BV -RRB- , trichomoniasis , gonorrhoea , and the presence of a genital ulcer . Regular douching was reported by 72 % of the women , of whom the majority inserted fluids in the vagina , generally after each sexual intercourse . Water with soap was the fluid most often used -LRB- 81 % -RRB- , followed by salty water -LRB- 18 % -RRB- , water alone -LRB- 9 % -RRB- , and a commercial antiseptic -LRB- 5 % -RRB- . Douching in general and douching with soap and water were significantly associated with bacterial vaginosis -LRB- p = 0.05 and p = 0.04 respectively -RRB- . There was a significant trend for increased frequency of douching and higher prevalence of BV . There was no direct relation observed between douching and risk for HIV infection or other STIs . The widespread habit of douching among African female sex workers was confirmed . The association between vaginal douching and BV is of concern , given the increased risk of HIV infection with BV , which has now been shown in several studies . It is unclear why we could not demonstrate a direct association between douching and HIV infection . Further research is required to better understand the complex relation between douching , risk for bacterial vaginosis , and risk for HIV and other STIs . This study aims to identify the alterations in cervicovaginal flora after insertion of TCu 380A which is a popular type of copper IUD . Among the women who visited the Department of Family Planning in our hospital during 1 month , 100 subjects who preferred IUDs for contraception and who had no history of local or systemic antibiotic use were considered eligible candidates . Anaerobic colonies , especially Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli were isolated at significantly higher rates after the insertion of TCu-380A . Aerobic colonies were isolated relatively less . It can be suggested that copper IUD causes the predominance of anaerobic species in the cervicovaginal flora , which is consistent with the literature . This clinically insignificant condition can be attributed to the copper content or threads of the IUDs . Yet there is no evidence that the prevalance of pelvic infections is influenced by the use of IUDs . The cervical bacterial flora of 18 healthy , parous , sexually active women was analysed before , and 3-5 months after insertion of a copper-releasing intrauterine device -LRB- IUD -RRB- and after long-term use of an IUD for 3-5.5 years in another nine women . No significant differences were found in the number of aerobic bacteria isolated before or after IUD insertion or after long-term use of an IUD . In contrast to aerobic bacteria , significantly more anaerobes were isolated in the cervix of women having used an IUD for several years when compared to those using barrier contraception with a condom . None of the women had clinical signs of pelvic infection and a cervical bacterial flora rich in anaerobes can be regarded as a normal finding in healthy sexually active women using an IUD for contraception .	This study was part of a randomised , placebo controlled trial of monthly prophylaxis with 1 g of azithromycin to prevent STIs and HIV infection in a cohort of Nairobi FSWs . The prevalence of HIV infection -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- and preterm birth was significantly higher in the study group -LRB- mean difference = 0.43 , 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- ; P < 0.001 -RRB- , and the mean difference was found between the two groups . Vaginal douching was not associated with a significant reduction in the prevalence of BV , and a mean reduction in women with the risk of HIV inflammatory disease compared with the control group , but there was no differences between the groups in the two group of the control subjects , but not statistically significant differences in the Nugent group -LRB- P = 0.01 -RRB- , whereas the difference between groups . There was no direct relation to presence of HIV function , and DNA amplification for women who had BV , but also increased in the women who received the control of laboratory testing . Vaginal douching and bacterial trachomatis at baseline and 6 % of the women were scheduled to two additional visits of local or systemic antibiotic use were considered associated with spontaneous preterm birth .
18	positive	none	none	none	The feasibility of using a limited-sampling algorithm for administration of vancomycin for treatment of vascular-access-related bacteremia in outpatient high flux hemodialysis was investigated . The original vancomycin-dosing algorithm used at our hemodialysis unit required stat orders for serum vancomycin concentrations before each hemodialysis session to determine the dose of vancomycin to be administered posthemodialysis . Vancomycin concentration data obtained using this original algorithm from January through September 2001 were retrospectively analyzed to determine how many vancomycin concentrations measured 5-20 microg/mL and identify potential clinical predictors of vancomycin removal . A total of 409 serum vancomycin concentrations were drawn during the study period . Ninety-seven percent of concentrations drawn were within 5-20 microg/mL . Mean + / - S.D. vancomycin removal was 39 % + / - 13 % . Based on these data , a revised algorithm with limited vancomycin sampling data was initiated in December 2002 . Retrospective analysis of concentrations obtained and achieved by this algorithm demonstrated a 70 % reduction in the number of vancomycin concentration determinations , with 93 % of these concentrations within 5-20 microg/mL . The estimated annual cost saving to the hemodialysis unit with the revised algorithm was 7552 dollars . A vancomycin-dosing algorithm using limited concentration monitoring for hemodialysis patients achieved comparable vancomycin concentrations to those found with more frequent monitoring and resulted in significant cost savings .

A single paired associative stimulation session can induce transient plasticity in spinal cord injury patients . We recruited two patients with motor-incomplete chronic -LRB- one para - and one tetraplegic -RRB- spinal cord injuries . The patients received paired associative stimulation for 20-24 weeks . The paraplegic patient , previously paralyzed below the knee level , regained plantarflexion and dorsiflexion of the ankles of both legs . The tetraplegic patient regained grasping ability . The newly acquired voluntary movements could be performed by the patients in the absence of stimulation and for at least 1 month after the last stimulation session . In this unblinded proof-of-principle demonstration in two subjects , long-term paired associative stimulation induced persistent and clinically relevant strengthening of neural connections and restored voluntary movement in previously paralyzed muscles . Further study is needed to confirm whether long-term paired associative stimulation can be used in rehabilitation after spinal cord injury by itself and , possibly , in combination with other therapeutic strategies .

Pazopanib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR-1 / 2/3 and PDGFR-α/β . We explored the feasibility and efficacy of adjuvant pazopanib in this population . In this double-blind phase II/III trial , patients with resected stage I NSCLC were randomized to placebo or pazopanib 800 mg/day -LRB- P800 -RRB- for 6 months with a two-step Fleming design . The primary endpoint was compliance -LRB- percentage of patients receiving ≥ 3 months pazopanib -RRB- .

21	negative	conflict	for hemorrhage after vaginal delivery was increased -LRB- OR = 1.29	but not statistically significant effect of the pregnancy of pregnancy -LRB- adjusted odds ratio = 1.29 	Antiepileptic drugs -LRB- AEDs -RRB- are known teratogens . Some specificity between different AEDs has been noted in the literature . The aim was to compare the teratogenic effect of valproic acid -LRB- VPA -RRB- and carbamazepine -LRB- CBZ -RRB- in monotherapy . Infants exposed to AEDs -LRB- n = 1398 -RRB- in early pregnancy were identified from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry . The number of infants with congenital malformations and exposed to AED was compared with the expected number estimated from all infants born -LRB- n = 582656 -RRB- . 90 % -LRB- 1256 -RRB- of the AED exposed children were exposed to AEDs in monotherapy , 56 % were exposed to CBZ and 21 % to VPA . The odds ratio -LRB- OR -RRB- for having a malformation in the AED exposed group was 1.86 -LSB- 95 % confidence interval -LRB- 95 % CI -RRB- 1.42-2.44 -RSB- . Exposure to VPA in monotherapy compared with CBZ in monotherapy gave OR = 2.51 -LRB- 95 % CI 1.43-4.68 -RRB- for a neonatal diagnosis of malformations . However , there is no information available on the number of therapeutic abortions , or the different types of epilepsy or drug dosage in the two treatment groups . There was a small increase in the risk of having a major malformation after exposure to AEDs in monotherapy . Exposure to VPA seems to carry a higher risk than exposure to CBZ . The aim of this study was to assess psychomotor development , using Griffiths ' test , and the incidence of minor anomalies at birth in children who had been exposed to antiepileptic drugs -LRB- AEDs -RRB- in utero . The study sample comprised 100 children of mothers who were treated with AEDs during pregnancy and 100 matched control children . Women with epilepsy were recruited from a pregnant urban population -LRB- 450 000 inhabitants -RRB- . The lowest possible dose of the fewest AEDs to maintain seizure control was used . Drug levels were controlled on a monthly basis . The children were assessed at 9 months of age . The study children had a significant increase in the number of minor anomalies -LRB- 31 compared with 18 control children ; odds ratio 2.4 , CI 1.15 to 5.02 , P = 0.02 McNemars test -RRB- , and an increased number of facial anomalies after carbamazepine exposure -LRB- 11 compared with six control children -RRB- . Drug exposure did not influence the Griffiths ' score at 9 months of age . Even a meticulous AED treatment strategy during pregnancy increases the number of minor anomalies . However , treatment with AEDs does not necessarily influence short-term psychomotor development . To study the risk for complications during pregnancy , delivery , and neonatal period after the use of antiepileptic drugs -LRB- AEDs -RRB- during pregnancy . Women treated with AEDs during pregnancy and with singleton deliveries were identified from the Swedish Medical Birth Registry during the period July 1 1995 to and including 2001 -LRB- n = 1350 -RRB- . Risk estimates were made using the Mantel-Haenszel procedure and comparisons with all singleton births in Sweden during this period -LRB- n = 559,491 -RRB- . Stratification was made for year of birth , maternal age , parity , and smoking habits . Most of the women -LRB- n = 1207 , 89 % -RRB- used AEDs in monotherapy . Carbamazepine was the most commonly used drug -LRB- n = 683 -RRB- , followed by valproic acid -LRB- n = 255 -RRB- . The rate of caesarean sections was significantly increased -LRB- OR = 1.64 , 95 % CI 1.43-1.89 -RRB- , but it was not possible to differentiate between elective and emergency sections . The risk for pre-eclampsia -LRB- OR = 1.66 , 95 % CI 1.32-2.08 -RRB- and for hemorrhage after vaginal delivery was increased -LRB- OR = 1.29 , 95 % CI 1.02-1.63 -RRB- . The neonates showed an increased risk for respiratory distress -LRB- OR = 2.06 , 95 % CI 1.62-2.63 -RRB- . The study demonstrates a slightly increased risk only for preeclampsia , vaginal hemorrhage after delivery , and respiratory distress in the newborn after the use of AEDs during pregnancy . To investigate the influence of maternal antiepileptic drug -LRB- AED -RRB- treatment on pregnancy duration , birth weight , body length , head circumference , and intrauterine growth in infants exposed in utero to antiepileptic drugs in Sweden between 1973-1997 , with 963 singleton infants . Data collected from -LRB- a -RRB- 1973-1981 -LRB- record linkage between a hospital discharge register and a medical birth register -RRB- ; -LRB- b -RRB- 1984-1995 -LRB- prospectively collected information in one defined catchment area with two delivery hospitals -RRB- ; and -LRB- c -RRB- 1995-1997 -LRB- medical birth register data -RRB- . Observed numbers of infants below a defined size for body measurements compared with expected numbers calculated from all births in Sweden after stratification for year of birth , maternal age , parity , and education or smoking habits in early pregnancy . Standard deviation scores estimated with same stratification procedures . Fraction of monotherapy exposures increased from approximately 40 % to approximately 90 % from 1973 to 1997 . Significantly increased numbers of infants with small body measurements found in exposed group . Negative influence on body dimensions decreased over time . More marked effects found in infants exposed to polytherapy . Significant effect on gestational age in girls and on number of small for gestational age -LRB- < 2 SD -RRB- in boys . Polytherapy with antiepileptic drugs and negative influence on body dimensions decreased . In monotherapy , only carbamazepine has a negative influence on body dimensions in this study . The aim of this study was to assess psychomotor development with the Griffiths ' test in preschool children exposed to antiepileptic drugs -LRB- AED -RRB- in utero . The study sample consisted of 76 children exposed to AED in utero and 71 unexposed children . The children -LRB- exposed and unexposed -RRB- have since birth been included in a population-based longitudinal follow-up study of children born to women with meticulously treated epilepsy during pregnancy , initiated in 1985 . In total , 67 exposed and 66 unexposed children were tested with the Griffiths ' test , which consists of 6 subsets : locomotor function , personal and social behaviour , hearing and speech , eye and hand coordination , performance , and practical reasoning . There was no significant difference in the global scores of the Griffiths ' test between the two groups of children . Children exposed to phenytoin in utero -LRB- n = 16 -RRB- showed a significant but subtle reduction in the scores for locomotor development compared with the unexposed children -LRB- mean scores : 98 vs 106 : 95 % confidence interval for the difference in mean scores : -14.0 to -0.4 -RRB- . There was no such difference for the children exposed to carbamazepine in utero -LRB- n = 35 -RRB- . The exposed children had significantly fewer siblings -LRB- p < 0.01 -RRB- . No other differences in socioeconomic status were observed between the groups . The subtle delay in locomotor development evaluated with the Griffiths ' test at 4.5-5 y of age in children exposed to phenytoin may indicate a subtle influence on psychomotor development , which may be more obvious at school age : thus , larger studies and further follow-up are warranted . In order to evaluate long-term effects on neurodevelopment in children born to women with epilepsy during pregnancy we studied the children 's school grades at age 16 . We used the Patient Register , the Medical Birth Register , and a local study at South Hospital , Stockholm , to identify women with epilepsy in Sweden who had given birth between 1973 and 1986 . The Swedish School Mark Registry was used to obtain information about school grades from the last year of compulsory school , at age 16 . Exposed children were compared to all other children born in Sweden between 1973 and 1986 . Medical records were analyzed for 1,235 children . Six hundred forty-one children had been exposed in utero to antiepileptic drugs -LRB- AEDs -RRB- in monotherapy , 429 in polytherapy , and 165 to no known AED . Children exposed to polytherapy had an increased risk of not receiving a final grade -- odds ratio -LRB- OR -RRB- 2.99 -LSB- 95 % confidence interval -LRB- CI -RRB- 2.14-4.17 -RSB- . Children exposed to monotherapy , mainly carbamazepine or phenytoin , did not have a significantly increased risk of not receiving a final grade-OR 1.19 -LRB- 95 % CI 0.79-1.80 -RRB- . Children born to women with epilepsy had a decreased chance of getting a `` pass with excellence . '' Exposure to several AEDs in utero may have negative effects on neurodevelopment , and polytherapy should , if possible , be avoided in pregnant women .	The rate of caesarean sections was significantly increased -LRB- OR = 1.64 , 95 % confidence interval -LRB- 95 % CI -RRB- 1.42-2.44 -RSB- . There was no difference in the incidence of respiratory distress in the pregnancy group -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , and a mean reduction in the risk of pregnancy was significantly higher in the two treatment groups . At adjustment , there was no differences between the two groups in the study group , and respiratory distress -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- . The odds ratio -LRB- OR -RRB- for having a major malformation after exposure to pregnancy -LRB- P = 683 -RRB- , followed by valproic acid -LRB- OR : 0.43 , P = 0.02 -RRB- , but not statistically significant effect of the pregnancy of pregnancy -LRB- adjusted odds ratio = 1.29 ; 95 % CrI = -RRB- , respectively , and the incidence rate reduction in all groups in pregnancy -LRB- p = 0.01 -RRB- . Women with epilepsy were recruited from a pregnant urban population -LRB- 450 -RRB- during children who had been exposed to antiepileptic drugs in Sweden between 1973-1997 , with 963 singleton infants -LRB- 11 compared with six control children ; odds ratio 2.4 , 1.43-4.68 -RRB- for a neonatal diagnosis of malformations .
22	negative	conflict	The sensitivity 	OBJECTIVE . Endoscopic ultrasonography -LRB- EUS -RRB- - guided fine-needle aspiration -LRB- EUS-FNA -RRB- may facilitate tissue sampling for histopathological diagnosis of subepithelial tumors -LRB- SETs -RRB- in the gastrointestinal -LRB- GI -RRB- tract . However , immunohistochemistry is not always feasible using EUS-FNA samples due to the low quality of specimens often obtained by aspiration . This study aimed to compare the use of 22-gauge -LRB- G -RRB- EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy -LRB- EUS-FNB -RRB- with 22G EUS-FNA for core sampling used for histopathological examination , including immunohistochemistry , in patients with GI SETs . METHODS . Twenty-eight patients with GI SETs ≥ 2 cm in size were prospectively enrolled at five university hospitals in Korea between January and June 2013 . They were randomized to undergo either EUS-FNB or EUS-FNA . RESULTS . A total of 22 patients was finally analyzed in this study : 10 and 12 patients underwent EUS-FNA and EUS-FNB , respectively . Compared to the EUS-FNA group , the EUS-FNB group had a significantly lower median number of needle passes to obtain macroscopically optimal core samples -LRB- 4 vs. 2 , p = 0.025 -RRB- ; higher yield rates of macroscopically and histologically optimal core samples with three needle passes -LRB- 30 % vs. 92 % , p = 0.006 ; 20 % vs. 75 % , p = 0.010 , respectively -RRB- ; and a higher diagnostic sufficiency rate -LRB- 20 % vs. 75 % , p = 0.010 -RRB- . No technical difficulties were encountered in either group . CONCLUSIONS . This study shows that EUS-FNB has a better ability to obtain histological core samples and a higher diagnostic sufficiency rate than EUS-FNA and that EUS-FNB is a feasible , safe , and preferable modality for adequate core sampling for histopathological diagnosis of GI SETs . Endoscopic ultrasound -LRB- EUS -RRB- with fine needle aspiration -LRB- FNA -RRB- is a safe and effective way to sample lesions in the gastrointestinal tract . Rapid on-site specimen evaluation -LRB- ROSE -RRB- improves the accuracy of EUS-FNA . While data suggests that EUS with fine-needle biopsy -LRB- EUS-FNB -RRB- is effective , it remains unclear if ROSE is predictive of a final diagnosis when obtaining core specimens . The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of ROSE in achieving a final diagnosis for EUS-FNB core specimens . We evaluated 60 consecutive patients referred for EUS guided sampling of lesions within or adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract . All patients underwent EUS-FNB to evaluate the additive value of ROSE to the diagnostic accuracy of specimens obtained using a core biopsy needle . EUS-FNA was also performed in a majority of cases . EUS-FNB was feasible in all 60 cases ; on-site specimen adequacy and final diagnostic accuracy was 58 % -LSB- 95 % confidence intervals -LRB- CI -RRB- 45.1-71.2 -RSB- and 83 % -LRB- 95 % CI 71.9-91.5 -RRB- , respectively . The sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value -LRB- PPV -RRB- , and negative predictive value of ROSE for core biopsies were 65 , 100 , 100 , and 39 % , respectively . On-site adequacy and diagnostic accuracy for EUS-FNA was 38 % -LRB- 95 % CI 22.2-53.5 -RRB- and 63 % -LRB- 95 % CI 50.1-75.8 -RRB- , respectively . There were no significant complications . EUS-FNB is safe , feasible , and effective . ROSE of the core biopsy provides excellent PPV ; however , an inadequate ROSE appears to be of limited value . Further prospective studies are needed to assess the optimal handling and onsite processing of core specimens to determine whether ROSE is beneficial for EUS-FNB . Retrospective cohort study of subjects who underwent EUS sampling of nonpancreatic adenocarcinoma lesions between February 2011 and May 2013 . Over the study period , there were 43 lesions biopsied in 41 unique patients in the EUS-FNB group and 53 patients in the EUS-FNA/B group . Overall diagnostic accuracy was similar between the EUS-FNB and EUS-FNA/B groups -LRB- 83.7 % vs. 84.9 % ; p = 1.0 -RRB- . In the subgroup of subepithelial mass lesions , diagnostic accuracy remained similar in the EUS-FNB and EUS-FNA/B groups -LRB- 81.0 % and 70.6 % ; p = 0.7 -RRB- . EUS-FNB procedures were significantly shorter than those in the EUS-FNA/B group -LRB- 58.4 minutes vs. 73.5 minutes ; p < 0.0001 -RRB- . EUS-FNB without on-site cytology provides a high diagnostic accuracy in nonpancreas adenocarcinoma lesions . There appears to be no additive benefit with initial EUS-FNA but this requires further study in a prospective study . Current limitations of EUS-guided FNA include the need for multiple passes and on-site cytology assessment and lack of core specimen . Recently , a new 25-gauge core biopsy needle -LRB- PC25 -RRB- was developed to overcome these limitations . To determine the diagnostic yield of EUS-guided FNA aspiration biopsy -LRB- FNAB -RRB- when using the PC25 needle among patients with solid pancreatic lesions . Retrospective analysis . Academic tertiary referral center . Fifty consecutive patients with a solid pancreatic lesion underwent EUS-guided FNAB with PC25 . EUS-guided FNAB with PC25 . The primary outcome was the diagnostic yield in single and overall passes of EUS-guided FNAB when using the PC25 needle for pancreatic solid lesions . Cytologic analysis showed malignancy in 38 patients on the first pass , with a cumulative sensitivity of 83 % , 91 % , and 96 % on passes 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively . Although visible core was reported in 46 patients -LRB- 92 % -RRB- , histologic core was seen in 16 patients -LRB- 32 % -RRB- . Histologic analysis showed malignancy in 29 patients on the first pass , with a cumulative sensitivity of 63 % and 87 % on pass 1 and passes 1 to 4 , respectively . The sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy in combined cytologic and histologic results were 85 % , 100 % , and 86 % for single pass and 96 % , 100 % , and 96 % on multiple passes , respectively . No complications were seen . A retrospective study design at a single center using a single arm . EUS-guided FNAB with the PC25 needle showed excellent single-pass and overall diagnostic yields . This needle appears to maintain a high cytologic yield , similar to standard 25-gauge FNA needles , while also providing some histologic core tissue . Contemporary EUS-guided FNA techniques involve the use of a needle , with an air column within the lumen , with or without suction . We describe a novel technique with an aim to improve the quality of the aspirate . To compare a novel `` wet suction '' technique -LRB- WEST -RRB- with the conventional FNA technique -LRB- CFNAT -RRB- of EUS-guided FNA using a 22-gauge FNA needle . Two large tertiary-care hospitals . All consecutive adult patients presenting for EUS with possible FNA of solid lesions were offered the chance to participate in the study . All lesions were sampled with the same needle by using alternating techniques . Patients were randomized to the WEST versus the CFNAT for the first pass . If the first pass was made with the WEST , the second pass was made with the CFNAT , and subsequent passes were made in an alternating manner by using the same sequence . All FNAs were performed using 22-gauge needles . Specimen adequacy , cellularity , and blood contamination of EUS-guided FNA aspirates graded on a predefined scale . The WEST yielded significantly higher cellularity in a cell block compared with the CFNAT , with a mean cellularity score of 1.82 ± 0.76 versus 1.45 ± 0.768 -LRB- P < .0003 -RRB- . The WEST cell block resulted in a significantly better specimen adequacy of 85.5 % versus 75.2 % -LRB- P < .035 -RRB- . There was no difference in the amount of blood contamination between the 2 techniques . Lack of cross check and grading by a second cytopathologist .	The sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy in combined cytologic and histologic results were 85 % , 100 % , and 86 % on passes 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively -RRB- ; and a higher diagnostic sufficiency rate -LRB- 20 % vs. 75 % , p = 0.7 -RRB- . There were no significant differences between the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-guided FNA -LRB- P < 0.0001 -RRB- . In the subgroup of EUS-guided patients , the EUS-FNB group was significantly higher in the EUS-guided group . The primary outcome was the diagnostic yield in single and overall passes of EUS-guided FNAB when using the PC25 group and 53 % -LRB- 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , P = 0.010 -RRB- . Histologic analysis showed malignancy in 29 patients on the FNA aspiration biopsy -LRB- PC25 -RRB- , and negative predictive value of ROSE for core biopsies were 65 vs. 2 , p < 0.025 -RRB- ; higher yield rates of macroscopically and histologically optimal core samples with three needle passes -LRB- 30 % vs. 92 % , respectively . EUS-guided FNAB with PC25 -RRB- with group samples due to the low quality of specimens often obtained by aspiration .
23	positive	none	none	none	Studies of delivery by caesarean section -LRB- c-section -RRB- and the offspring 's risk of allergic diseases are of current interest due to concerns about the increased use of c-section in many countries . However , previous studies have reported inconsistent findings . We investigated whether delivery by c-section is associated with an increased risk of atopy and allergic disease by reviewing the literature , performing a meta-analysis , and assessing publication bias . We used a systematic literature search of MEDLINE -LRB- 1966 to May 2007 -RRB- . Six common allergic outcomes were included : food allergy/food atopy , inhalant atopy , eczema/atopic dermatitis , allergic rhinitis , asthma , and hospitalization for asthma . For each outcome a meta-analysis was performed , where a summary odds ratio -LRB- OR -RRB- was calculated taking into account heterogeneity between the study-specific relative risks . Publication bias was assessed using the funnel plot method . We identified 26 studies on delivery by c-section and one or more of the six allergic outcomes . C-section was associated with an increased summary OR of food allergy/food atopy -LRB- OR 1.32 , 95 % CI 1.12-1.55 ; six studies -RRB- , allergic rhinitis -LRB- OR 1.23 , 95 % CI 1.12-1.35 ; seven studies -RRB- , asthma -LRB- OR 1.18 , 95 % CI 1.05-1.32 ; 13 studies -RRB- , and hospitalization for asthma -LRB- OR 1.21 , 95 % CI 1.12-1.31 ; seven studies -RRB- , whereas there was no association with inhalant atopy -LRB- OR 1.06 , 95 % CI 0.82-1.38 ; four studies -RRB- and eczema/atopic dermatitis -LRB- OR 1.03 , 95 % CI 0.98-1.09 ; six studies -RRB- . Funnel plots indicated that the association with food allergy/food atopy could be difficult to interpret due to publication bias . For each significant association with an allergic outcome , only 1-4 % of cases were attributable to c-section . Delivery by c-section is associated with a moderate risk increase for allergic rhinitis , asthma , hospitalization for asthma , and perhaps food allergy/food atopy , but not with inhalant atopy or atopic dermatitis . The increased use of c-section during the last decades is unlikely to have contributed much to the allergy epidemic observed during the same period . Children born by Caesarean section have modified intestinal bacterial colonization and consequently may have an increased risk of developing asthma under the hygiene hypothesis . The results of previous studies that have investigated the association between Caesarean section and asthma have been conflicting . To review published literature and perform a meta-analysis summarizing the evidence in support of an association between children born by Caesarean section and asthma . MEDLINE , Web Science , Google Scholar and PubMed were searched to identify relevant studies . Odds ratio -LRB- OR -RRB- and 95 % confidence interval -LRB- CI -RRB- were calculated for each study from the reported prevalence of asthma in children born by Caesarean section and in control children . Meta-analysis was then used to derive a combined OR and test for heterogeneity in the findings between studies . Twenty-three studies were identified . The overall meta-analysis revealed an increase in the risk of asthma in children delivered by Caesarean section -LRB- OR = 1.22 , 95 % CI 1.14 , 1.29 -RRB- . However , in this analysis , there was evidence of heterogeneity -LRB- I -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 46 % -RRB- that was statistically significant -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- . Restricting the analysis to childhood studies , this heterogeneity was markedly decreased -LRB- I -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 32 % -RRB- and no longer attained statistical significance -LRB- P = 0.08 -RRB- . In these studies , there was also evidence of an increase -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- in the risk of asthma after Caesarean section -LRB- OR = 1.20 , 95 % CI 1.14 , 12.6 -RRB- . In this meta-analysis , we found a 20 % increase in the subsequent risk of asthma in children who had been delivered by Caesarean section . It has been hypothesized that cesarean delivery might have an impact on the development of atopic diseases because of its gut flora modulating properties . In the present study , we analysed the association between cesarean delivery and atopic diseases using data of 2500 infants enrolled in the LISA-Study , a German prospective multicenter birth cohort study . Data on symptoms and physician-diagnosed atopic diseases were gathered by questionnaires shortly after birth and at infant 's age 6 , 12 , 18 , and 24 months . In addition , sensitization to common food and inhalant allergens was assessed by measuring specific immunoglobulin E -LRB- IgE -RRB- using the CAP-RAST FEIA method at the age of 2 yr . Confounder-adjusted odds ratios -LRB- aOR -RRB- with 95 % confidence intervals -LRB- CI -RRB- were calculated by multiple logistic regression . We found a positive association between cesarean delivery and occurrence of at least one episode of wheezing -LSB- aOR 1.31 -LRB- 95 % CI 1.02-1.68 -RRB- -RSB- and of recurrent wheezing -LSB- 1.41 -LRB- 1.02-1.96 -RRB- -RSB- during the first 2 yr of life . Furthermore , effect estimates for allergic sensitization defined as at least one specific IgE > / = 0.70 kU/l against any allergen -LSB- 1.48 -LRB- 0.98-2.24 -RRB- -RSB- , against food allergens -LSB- 1.64 -LRB- 1.03-2.63 -RRB- -RSB- , and against inhalant allergens -LSB- 1.75 -LRB- 0.98-3.12 -RRB- -RSB- were increased . Symptoms of atopic dermatitis -LSB- 1.21 -LRB- 0.92-1.59 -RRB- -RSB- , physician-diagnosed atopic dermatitis -LSB- 1.04 -LRB- 0.79-1.39 -RRB- -RSB- , and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis -LSB- 1.40 -LRB- 0.80-2.44 -RRB- -RSB- were only marginally increased in children delivered by cesarean section . In conclusion , our results suggest that cesarean delivery may be an additional risk factor for wheezing and allergic sensitization at least to food allergens up to the age of 2 yr . This should be considered when cesarean section is done for other than medical reasons . The composition of the intestinal flora in young children , if unfavourable , may increase the susceptibility to allergic disorders . Beneficial intestinal microbes originate from the maternal vaginal tract and thus are more likely to be transferred during vaginal births than during Caesarean sections -LRB- C-sections -RRB- . To determine whether children born by C-section have a different risk of allergic disorders compared with those delivered vaginally . We also tested the hypothesis that the risk of allergic disorders is highest for children born after ` repeat C-sections ' . A retrospective cohort study of 8,953 children aged 3-10 years . Children diagnosed with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis -LRB- AR -RRB- , asthma , atopic dermatitis -LRB- AD -RRB- , or food allergies were identified from the Kaiser Permanente Northwest Region electronic records . The children 's sex , birth weight , birth order , postnatal exposure to antibiotics as well as the mothers ' age , ethnicity , education , marital status , smoking status during pregnancy , and use of asthma or hayfever medications were identified through the mothers ' medical records or through the Oregon Birth Registry . The risk of being diagnosed with AR was significantly higher in the children born by C-section than in those delivered vaginally : adjusted odds ratio -LRB- OR -RRB- = 1.37 % , 95 % confidence interval -LRB- CI -RRB- = 1.14-1.63 . Delivery by C-section was also associated with the subsequent diagnosis of asthma -LRB- OR = 1.24 % , 95 % CI = 1.01-1.53 -RRB- ; this association was gender specific , with a positive association restricted to girls -LRB- OR for asthma in girls : OR = 1.53 % , 95 % CI = 1.11-2.10 ; in boys : OR = 1.08 % , 95 % CI = 0.81-1.43 -RRB- . There was no significant association between mode of delivery and AD . If children born in a ` repeat C-section ' were considered separately the risk of being diagnosed with AR increased further -LRB- OR = 1.78 % , 95 % CI = 1.34-2.37 -RRB- . The same increase was noted for asthma in girls -LRB- OR = 1.83 % , 95 % CI = 1.13-2.97 -RRB- but not in boys . Caesarean sections may be associated with an increased risk of developing AR in childhood . Cesarean delivery might delay the colonization of the newborn intestine . A delayed or aberrant colonization process has been offered as an explanation for the increase in allergic diseases . The aim of this study was to examine whether cesarean delivery and the use of antibiotics were associated with subsequent food allergy . In a population-based birth cohort of 2803 children , information regarding mode of delivery , maternal or infant use of antibiotics , and information on potential confounders was obtained prospectively from parental reports and the Norwegian Birth Registry . Parentally perceived reactions to egg , fish , or nuts , as well as objectively confirmed reactions to egg at the age of 2 1/2 years , were chosen as outcomes . Among children whose mothers were allergic , cesarean section was associated with a 7-fold increased risk of parentally perceived reactions to egg , fish , or nuts -LRB- odds ratio , 7.0 ; CI , 1.8-28 ; P = .005 -RRB- and a 4-fold increased risk of confirmed egg allergy -LRB- odds ratio , 4.1 ; CI , 0.9-19 ; P = .08 -RRB- in a logistic regression analysis , adjusting for pregnancy complications , birth weight , gestational length , and socioeconomic factors . Among children whose mothers were not allergic , the association was much weaker and not significant . Maternal or infant use of antibiotics was not associated with an increased risk of food allergy . The results indicate that in predisposed children cesarean section might increase the risk of development of food allergy , which supports the theory that factors interfering with the colonization process might play a role in the development of food allergy . Individuals with inactive alleles of the fucosyltransferase 2 gene -LRB- FUT2 ; termed the ` secretor ' gene -RRB- are common in many populations . Some members of the genus Bifidobacterium , common infant gut commensals , are known to consume 2 ' - fucosylated glycans found in the breast milk of secretor mothers . We investigated the effects of maternal secretor status on the developing infant microbiota with a special emphasis on bifidobacterial species abundance . On average , bifidobacteria were established earlier and more often in infants fed by secretor mothers than in infants fed by non-secretor mothers . In secretor-fed infants , the relative abundance of the Bifidobacterium longum group was most strongly correlated with high percentages of the order Bifidobacteriales . Conversely , in non-secretor-fed infants , Bifidobacterium breve was positively correlated with Bifidobacteriales , while the B. longum group was negatively correlated . A higher percentage of bifidobacteria isolated from secretor-fed infants consumed 2 ' - fucosyllactose . Infant feces with high levels of bifidobacteria had lower milk oligosaccharide levels in the feces and higher amounts of lactate . Furthermore , feces containing different bifidobacterial species possessed differing amounts of oligosaccharides , suggesting differential consumption in situ . Infants fed by non-secretor mothers are delayed in the establishment of a bifidobacteria-laden microbiota . This delay may be due to difficulties in the infant acquiring a species of bifidobacteria able to consume the specific milk oligosaccharides delivered by the mother . This work provides mechanistic insight into how milk glycans enrich specific beneficial bacterial populations in infants and reveals clues for enhancing enrichment of bifidobacterial populations in at risk populations - such as premature infants . Oligosaccharides in human milk represent a group of bioactive molecules that have evolved to be an abundant and diverse component of human milk , even though they have no direct nutritive value to the infant . A recent hypothesis proposes that they could be substrates for the development of the intestinal microflora and the mucosal immune system . The inability to determine the exact composition of these oligosaccharides limits research and the ability to understand their biological functions . Oligosaccharides isolated from the lipids and proteins of individual human milk samples were analyzed by a combination of techniques including microchip liquid chromatography mass spectrometry -LRB- HPLC-Chip/MS -RRB- and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry -LRB- MALDI-FT ICR MS -RRB- . Accurate mass measurements obtained using an orthogonal time-of-flight -LRB- o-TOF -RRB- mass spectrometry provided oligosaccharide composition for approximately 200 individual molecular species . Comparison of HPLC-Chip/MS profiles from five different women revealed variations in milk oligosaccharide compositions . HPLC-Chip/MS profiling provides a method for routinely identifying milk oligosaccharides . Tandem MS in combination with exoglycosidase digestion provides unambiguous differentiation of structural isomers . Human milk is a complex biological fluid that provides not only primary nourishment for infants but also protection against pathogens and influences their metabolic , immunologic , and even cognitive development . The presence of oligosaccharides in remarkable abundance in human milk has been associated to provide diverse biological functions including directing the development of an infant 's intestinal microflora and immune system . Recent advances in analytical tools offer invaluable insights in understanding the specific functions and health benefits these biomolecules impart to infants . Oligosaccharides in human milk samples obtained from five different individual donors over the course of a 3 month lactation period were isolated and analyzed using HPLC-Chip/TOF-MS technology . The levels and compositions of oligosaccharides in human milk were investigated from five individual donors . Comparison of HPLC-Chip/TOF-MS oligosaccharides profiles revealed heterogeneity among multiple individuals with no significant variations at different stages of lactation within individual donors . Oligosaccharides are the third most abundant component in human milk . In the past decades , it became apparent that they would be able to protect against pathogens and participate in the development of the gut microflora for infants . However , their role in infants ' nutrition and development remains poorly understood . To better understand this function , it is extremely important to have a quantitative tool for profiling oligosaccharides . In this article , we show the development of a method to quantitatively differentiate the relative amounts of oligosaccharides fermented by different intestinal bacteria . To determine the oligosaccharide consumption , bacteria were grown in a medium using human milk oligosaccharides -LRB- HMOs -RRB- as the only carbon source purified from breast milk and further analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry -LRB- MALDI-FTICR MS -RRB- . A method using an internal deuterium-labeled standard was developed and compared with an external standard method , with the internal standard method giving better precision and unambiguous measurements than the external standard method and providing to be a novel and robust tool for following bacterial fermentation of milk oligosaccharides . Following birth , the breast-fed infant gastrointestinal tract is rapidly colonized by a microbial consortium often dominated by bifidobacteria . Accordingly , the complete genome sequence of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC15697 reflects a competitive nutrient-utilization strategy targeting milk-borne molecules which lack a nutritive value to the neonate . Several chromosomal loci reflect potential adaptation to the infant host including a 43 kbp cluster encoding catabolic genes , extracellular solute binding proteins and permeases predicted to be active on milk oligosaccharides . An examination of in vivo metabolism has detected the hallmarks of milk oligosaccharide utilization via the central fermentative pathway using metabolomic and proteomic approaches . Finally , conservation of gene clusters in multiple isolates corroborates the genomic mechanism underlying milk utilization for this infant-associated phylotype . A promising strategy to improve health is the rational manipulation of one 's beneficial microbiota via dietary interventions . This is observed in nature where specific bifidobacteria utilize human milk oligosaccharides -LRB- HMOs -RRB- that are encountered within the breast-fed infant colon . Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis is regarded as the archetypical HMO consumer associated with the developing neonate . This review summarizes the known molecular mechanisms underlying HMO utilization , as determined for bifidobacterial commensals . In addition , future directions of HMO research are discussed with an emphasis on physiological , ecological and clinical approaches to understand bifidobacterial utilization of this intriguing substrate . Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 utilizes several small-mass neutral human milk oligosaccharides -LRB- HMOs -RRB- , several of which are fucosylated . Whereas previous studies focused on endpoint consumption , a temporal glycan consumption profile revealed a time-dependent effect . Specifically , among preferred HMOs , tetraose was favored early in fermentation , with other oligosaccharides consumed slightly later . In order to utilize fucosylated oligosaccharides , ATCC 15697 possesses several fucosidases , implicating GH29 and GH95 α-L-fucosidases in a gene cluster dedicated to HMO metabolism . Evaluation of the biochemical kinetics demonstrated that ATCC 15697 expresses three fucosidases with a high turnover rate . Moreover , several ATCC 15697 fucosidases are active on the linkages inherent to the HMO molecule . Finally , the HMO cluster GH29 α-L-fucosidase possesses a crystal structure that is similar to previously characterized fucosidases . Lactating mothers secrete milk sialyloligosaccharides -LRB- MSOs -RRB- that function as anti-adhesives once provided to the neonate . Particular infant-associated commensals , such as Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis , consume neutral milk oligosaccharides , although their ability to utilize acidic oligosaccharides has not been assessed . Temporal glycoprofiling of acidic HMO consumed during fermentation demonstrated a single composition , with several isomers , corresponding to sialylated lacto-N-tetraose . To utilize MSO , B. longum subsp. infantis deploys a sialidase that cleaves α2-6 and α2-3 linkages . NanH2 , encoded within the HMO catabolic cluster is up-regulated during HMO fermentation and is active on sialylated lacto-N-tetraose . These results demonstrate that commensal microorganisms do utilize MSO , a substrate that may be enriched in the distal gastrointestinal tract . Bifidobacteria are commonly used as probiotics in dairy foods . Select bifidobacterial species are also early colonizers of the breast-fed infant colon ; however , the mechanism for this enrichment is unclear . We previously showed that Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis is a prototypical bifidobacterial species that can readily utilize human milk oligosaccharides as the sole carbon source . MS-based glycoprofiling has revealed that numerous B. infantis strains preferentially consume small mass oligosaccharides , abundant in human milks . Genome sequencing revealed that B. infantis possesses a bias toward genes required to use mammalian-derived carbohydrates . Biochemical and molecular characterization of the encoded glycosidases and transport proteins has further resolved the mechanism by which B. infantis selectively imports and catabolizes milk oligosaccharides . Expression studies indicate that many of these key functions are only induced during growth on milk oligosaccharides and not expressed during growth on other prebiotics . Analysis of numerous B. infantis isolates has confirmed that these genomic features are common among the B. infantis subspecies and likely constitute a competitive colonization strategy used by these unique bifidobacteria . By detailed characterization of the molecular mechanisms responsible , these studies provide a conceptual framework for bifidobacterial persistence and host interaction in the infant gastrointestinal tract mediated in part through consumption of human milk oligosaccharides . Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis -LRB- B. infantis -RRB- is a common member of the infant intestinal microbiota , and it has been characterized by its foraging capacity for human milk oligosaccharides -LRB- HMO -RRB- . Its genome sequence revealed an overabundance of the Family 1 of solute binding proteins -LRB- F1SBPs -RRB- , part of ABC transporters and associated with the import of oligosaccharides . In this study we have used the Mammalian Glycan Array to determine the specific affinities of these proteins . This was correlated with binding protein expression induced by different prebiotics including HMO . Half of the F1SBPs in B. infantis were determined to bind mammalian oligosaccharides . Their affinities included different blood group structures and mucin oligosaccharides . Related to HMO , other proteins were specific for oligomers of lacto-N-biose -LRB- LNB -RRB- and polylactosamines with different degrees of fucosylation . Growth on HMO induced the expression of specific binding proteins that import HMO isomers , but also bind blood group and mucin oligosaccharides , suggesting coregulated transport mechanisms . The prebiotic inulin induced other family 1 binding proteins with affinity for intestinal glycans . Most of the host glycan F1SBPs in B. infantis do not have homologs in other bifidobacteria . Finally , some of these proteins were found to be adherent to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro . In conclusion , this study represents further evidence for the particular adaptations of B. infantis to the infant gut environment , and helps to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in this process . Breastfeeding is one of the main factors guiding the composition of the infant gut microbiota in the first months of life . This process is shaped in part by the high amounts of human milk oligosaccharides that serve as a carbon source for saccharolytic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium species . Infant-borne bifidobacteria have developed various molecular strategies for utilizing these oligosaccharides as a carbon source . We hypothesized that these species also interact with N-glycans found in host glycoproteins that are structurally similar to free oligosaccharides in human milk . Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidases were identified in certain isolates of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum , B. longum subsp. infantis , and Bifidobacterium breve , and their presence correlated with the ability of these strains to deglycosylate glycoproteins . An endoglycosidase from B. infantis ATCC 15697 , EndoBI-1 , was active toward all major types of N-linked glycans found in glycosylated proteins . Its activity was not affected by core fucosylation or extensive fucosylation , antenna number , or sialylation , releasing several N-glycans from human lactoferrin and immunoglobulins A and G. Extensive N-deglycosylation of whole breast milk was also observed after coincubation with this enzyme . Mutation of the active site of EndoBI-1 did not abolish binding to N-glycosylated proteins , and this mutant specifically recognized Man -LRB- 3 -RRB- GlcNAc -LRB- 2 -RRB- -LRB- α1-6Fuc -RRB- , the core structure of human N-glycans . EndoBI-1 is constitutively expressed in B. infantis , and incubation of the bacterium with human or bovine lactoferrin led to the induction of genes associated to import and consumption of human milk oligosaccharides , suggesting linked regulatory mechanisms among these glycans . This work reveals an unprecedented interaction of bifidobacteria with host N-glycans and describes a novel endoglycosidase with broad specificity on diverse N-glycan types , potentially a useful tool for glycoproteomics studies . Prebiotics are non-digestible substrates that stimulate the growth of beneficial microbial populations in the intestine , especially Bifidobacterium species . Among them , fructo - and galacto-oligosaccharides are commonly used in the food industry , especially as a supplement for infant formulas . Mechanistic details on the enrichment of bifidobacteria by these prebiotics are important to understand the effects of these dietary interventions . In this study the consumption of galactooligosaccharides was studied for 22 isolates of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis , one of the most representative species in the infant gut microbiota . In general all isolates showed a vigorous growth on these oligosaccharides , but consumption of larger galactooligosaccharides was variable . Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697 has five genes encoding β-galactosidases , and three of them were induced during bacterial growth on commercial galactooligosaccharides . Recombinant β-galactosidases from B. infantis ATCC 15697 displayed different preferences for β-galactosides such as 4 ' and 6 ' - galactobiose , and four β-galactosidases in this strain released monosaccharides from galactooligosaccharides . Finally , we determined the amounts of short chain fatty acids produced by strain ATCC 15697 after growth on different prebiotics . We observed that biomass and product yields of substrate were higher for lactose and galactooligosaccharides , but the amount of acids produced per cell was larger after growth on human milk oligosaccharides . These results provide a molecular basis for galactooligosaccharide consumption in B. infantis , and also represent evidence for physiological differences in the metabolism of prebiotics that might have a differential impact on the host . Human milk contains high amounts of complex oligosaccharides , which can be utilized especially by Bifidobacterium species in the infant gut as a carbon and energy source . N-acetyl-D-glucosamine is a building block of these oligosaccharides , and molecular details on the release and utilization of this monosaccharide are not fully understood . In this work we have studied some of the enzymatic properties of three N-acetyl-β-D-hexosaminidases encoded by the genome of the intestinal isolate Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 and the gene expression of the corresponding genes during bacterial growth on human milk oligosaccharides . These enzymes belong to the glycosyl hydrolase family 20 , with several homologs in bifidobacteria . Their optimum pH was 5.0 and optimum temperature was 37 °C . The three enzymes were active on the GlcNAcβ1-3 linkage found in lacto-N-tetraose , the most abundant human milk oligosaccharide . Blon _ 0459 and Blon _ 0732 , but not Blon _ 2355 , cleaved branched GlcNAcβ1-6 linkages found in lacto-N-hexaose , another oligosaccharide abundant in breast milk . Bifidobacterium infantis N-acetyl-β-D-hexosaminidases were induced during early growth in vitro on human milk oligosaccharides , and also during growth on lacto-N-tetraose or lacto-N-neotetraose . The up-regulation of enzymes that convert this monosaccharide into UDP-N-acetylglucosamine by human milk oligosaccharides suggested that this activated sugar is used in peptidoglycan biosynthesis . These results emphasize the complexity of human milk oligosaccharide consumption by this infant intestinal isolate , and provide new clues into this process . Human milk contains large amounts of complex oligosaccharides that putatively modulate the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants by acting as decoy binding sites for pathogens and as prebiotics for enrichment of beneficial bacteria . Several bifidobacterial species have been shown to grow well on human milk oligosaccharides . However , few data exist on other bacterial species . This work examined 16 bacterial strains belonging to 10 different genera for growth on human milk oligosaccharides . For this propose , a chemically defined medium , ZMB1 , was used , which allows vigorous growth of a number of gut-related microorganisms in a fashion similar to complex media . Interestingly , Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis , Bacteroides fragilis , and Bacteroides vulgatus strains were able to metabolize milk oligosaccharides with high efficiency , whereas Enterococcus , Streptococcus , Veillonella , Eubacterium , Clostridium , and Escherichia coli strains grew less well or not at all . Mass spectrometry-based glycoprofiling of the oligosaccharide consumption behavior revealed a specific preference for fucosylated oligosaccharides by Bi . longum subsp. infantis and Ba . vulgatus . This work expands the current knowledge of human milk oligosaccharide consumption by gut microbes , revealing bacteroides as avid consumers of this substrate . These results provide insight on how human milk oligosaccharides shape the infant intestinal microbiota . The molecular basis by which human breast milk supports the development of a protective intestinal microbiome in infants is unknown . After lactose and lipids , human milk oligosaccharides -LRB- HMOs -RRB- are quantitatively the third largest and most diverse component of breast milk . In this work , glycomic profiling of HMO consumption by bifidobacteria using Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry reveals that one species , Bifidobacterium longum biovar infantis ATCC 15697 , an isolate from the infant gut , preferentially consumes small mass oligosaccharides , representing 63.9 % of the total HMOs available . These HMOs were detected in human breast milk at the onset and constantly through the first month of lactation by use of high performance liquid chromatography-chip time-of-flight mass spectrometry . Further characterization revealed that strain ATCC 15697 possesses both fucosidase and sialidase activities not present in the other tested strains . This work provides evidence that these small mass HMOs are selectively metabolized by select bifidobacterial strains and represent a potential new class of bioactive molecules functioning as prebiotics to facilitate a protective gut colonization in breast-fed newborns . Human milk oligosaccharides -LRB- HMOs -RRB- are the third-largest solid component of milk . Their structural complexity renders them nondigestible to the host but liable to hydrolytic enzymes of the infant colonic microbiota . Bifidobacteria and , frequently , Bifidobacterium longum strains predominate the colonic microbiota of exclusively breast-fed infants . Among the three recognized subspecies of B. longum , B. longum subsp. infantis achieves high levels of cell growth on HMOs and is associated with early colonization of the infant gut . The B. longum subsp. infantis ATCC 15697 genome features five distinct gene clusters with the predicted capacity to bind , cleave , and import milk oligosaccharides . Comparative genomic hybridizations -LRB- CGHs -RRB- were used to associate genotypic biomarkers among 15 B. longum strains exhibiting various HMO utilization phenotypes and host associations . Multilocus sequence typing provided taxonomic subspecies designations and grouped the strains between B. longum subsp. infantis and B. longum subsp. longum . CGH analysis determined that HMO utilization gene regions are exclusively conserved across all B. longum subsp. infantis strains capable of growth on HMOs and have diverged in B. longum subsp. longum strains that can not grow on HMOs . These regions contain fucosidases , sialidases , glycosyl hydrolases , ABC transporters , and family 1 solute binding proteins and are likely needed for efficient metabolism of HMOs . Urea metabolism genes and their activity were exclusively conserved in B. longum subsp. infantis . These results imply that the B. longum has at least two distinct subspecies : B. longum subsp. infantis , specialized to utilize milk carbon , and B. longum subsp. longum , specialized for plant-derived carbon metabolism . The succession of bacterial populations in the large bowel of seven breast-fed and seven formula-fed infants was examined during the first year of life . The composition of the intestinal microflora varied according to the infant 's diet . During the first week of life breast-fed and formula-fed infants were colonised by enterobacteria and enterococci followed by bifidobacteria , Bacteroides spp. , clostridia and anaerobic streptococci . From week 4 until solid foods were given , breast-fed babies had a simple flora consisting of bifidobacteria and relatively few enterobacteria and enterococci . Formula-fed babies during the corresponding period were more often colonised by other anaerobes in addition to bifidobacteria and had higher counts of facultatively anaerobic bacteria . The introduction of solid food to the breast-fed infants caused a major disturbance in the microbial ecology of the large bowel as counts of enterobacteria and enterococci rose sharply and colonisation by Bacteroides spp. , clostridia and anaerobic streptococci occurred . This was not observed when formula-fed infants began to take solids ; instead , counts of facultative anaerobes remained high while colonisation by anaerobes other than bifidobacteria continued . At 12 months , the anaerobic bacterial populations of the large bowel of breast-fed and formula-fed infants were beginning to resemble those of adults in number and composition and there was a corresponding decrease in the number of facultative anaerobes . These changes are discussed in relation to changes in susceptibility to gastro-intestinal infection . A healthy intestinal microbiota is considered to be important for priming of the infants ' mucosal and systemic immunity . Breast-fed infants typically have an intestinal microbiota dominated by different Bifidobacterium species . It has been described that allergic infants have different levels of specific Bifidobacterium species than healthy infants . For the accurate quantification of Bifidobacterium adolescentis , Bifidobacterium angulatum , Bifidobacterium bifidum , Bifidobacterium breve , Bifidobacterium catenulatum , Bifidobacterium dentium , Bifidobacterium infantis , and Bifidobacterium longum in fecal samples , duplex 5 ' nuclease assays were developed . The assays , targeting rRNA gene intergenic spacer regions , were validated and compared with conventional PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization methods . The 5 ' nuclease assays were subsequently used to determine the relative amounts of different Bifidobacterium species in fecal samples from infants receiving a standard formula or a standard formula supplemented with galacto - and fructo-oligosaccharides -LRB- OSF -RRB- . A breast-fed group was studied in parallel as a reference . The results showed a significant increase in the total amount of fecal bifidobacteria -LRB- 54.8 % + / - 9.8 % to 73.4 % + / - 4.0 % -RRB- in infants receiving the prebiotic formula -LRB- OSF -RRB- , with a diversity of Bifidobacterium species similar to breast-fed infants . The intestinal microbiota of infants who received a standard formula seems to resemble a more adult-like distribution of bifidobacteria and contains relatively more B. catenulatum and B. adolescentis -LRB- 2.71 % + / - 1.92 % and 8.11 % + / - 4.12 % , respectively , versus 0.15 % + / - 0.11 % and 1.38 % + / - 0.98 % for the OSF group -RRB- . In conclusion , the specific prebiotic infant formula used induces a fecal microbiota that closely resembles the microbiota of breast-fed infants also at the level of the different Bifidobacterium species . The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of a broad range of external influences to the gut microbiotic composition in early infancy . Fecal samples from 1032 infants at 1 month of age , who were recruited from the KOALA Birth Cohort Study in the Netherlands , were subjected to quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for the enumeration of bifidobacteria , Escherichia coli , Clostridium difficile , Bacteroides fragilis group , lactobacilli , and total bacterial counts . Information on potential determinants of the gut microbiotic composition was collected with repeated questionnaires . The associations between these factors and the selected gut bacteria were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses . Infants born through cesarean section had lower numbers of bifidobacteria and Bacteroides , whereas they were more often colonized with C difficile , compared with vaginally born infants . Exclusively formula-fed infants were more often colonized with E coli , C difficile , Bacteroides , and lactobacilli , compared with breastfed infants . Hospitalization and prematurity were associated with higher prevalence and counts of C difficile . Antibiotic use by the infant was associated with decreased numbers of bifidobacteria and Bacteroides . Infants with older siblings had slightly higher numbers of bifidobacteria , compared with infants without siblings . The most important determinants of the gut microbiotic composition in infants were the mode of delivery , type of infant feeding , gestational age , infant hospitalization , and antibiotic use by the infant . Term infants who were born vaginally at home and were breastfed exclusively seemed to have the most `` beneficial '' gut microbiota -LRB- highest numbers of bifidobacteria and lowest numbers of C difficile and E coli -RRB- . Perturbations in the intestinal microbiota may disrupt mechanisms involved in the development of immunologic tolerance . The present study aimed to examine the establishment of the infant microbiota and its association to the development of atopic dermatitis -LRB- AD -RRB- . Within a randomized , placebo-controlled trial on the prevention of AD by oral supplementation of a bacterial lysate between week 5 and the end of month 7 , feces was collected at the ages of 5 weeks -LRB- n = 571 -RRB- , 13 weeks -LRB- n = 332 -RRB- , and 31 weeks -LRB- n = 499 -RRB- and subjected to quantitative PCRs to detect bifidobacteria , bacteroides , lactobacilli , Escherichia coli , Clostridium difficile , and Clostridium cluster I. Birth mode , breast-feeding but also birth order had a strong effect on the microbiota composition . With increasing number of older siblings the colonization rates at age 5 weeks of lactobacilli -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- and bacteroides -LRB- P = .02 -RRB- increased , whereas rates of clostridia decreased -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- . Colonization with clostridia , at the age of 5 and 13 weeks was also associated with an increased risk of developing AD in the subsequent 6 months of life -LRB- odds ratioadjusted = 2.35 ; 95 % CI , 1.36-3.94 and 2.51 ; 1.30-4.86 , respectively -RRB- . Mediation analyses demonstrated that there was a statistically significant indirect effect via Clostridium cluster I colonization for both birth mode and birth order in association to AD . The results of this study are supportive for a role of the microbiota in the development of AD . Moreover , the `` beneficial '' influence of older siblings on the microbiota composition suggests that this microbiota may be one of the biological mechanisms underlying the sibling effect . The fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined . Bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups . Conversely , the counts of most of the other bacteria , such as bacteroides , eubacteria , peptococci , veillonella , clostridia , enterobacteria , streptococci , and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group . The frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia , clostridia-others , pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group . Twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group . The organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was Bifidobacterium breve . Bifidobacterium infantis , which was formerly the most prevalent Bifidobacterium species in baby feces , was never isolated in this study . Further , the counts and incidences of Clostridium paraputrificum , C. perfringens , and Bacillus subtilis , the counts of C. clostridiiforme , Bacteroides vulgatus , Veillonella parvula , Lactobacillus acidophilus , Escherichia coli , Streptococcus bovis , S. faecalis , and S. faecium and the incidences of C. difficile , C. tertium , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants . To determine the influence of either exclusive breast-feeding or formula feeding on both composition and quantity of the gut microbiota in infants , we have developed real-time , quantitative PCR assays for the detection of Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium difficile . Furthermore , we have monitored the prevalence and counts of Escherichia coli by applying a previously described real-time PCR assay . We found all 100 infants tested to be colonized by Bifidobacterium spp. . The bifidobacterial counts were comparable between the 50 breast-fed and 50 formula-fed infants with median values of 10.56 log10 and 10.24 log10 CFU g -LRB- -1 -RRB- wet weight faeces , respectively . C. difficile was detected in 14 % of the breast-fed and 30 % of the formula-fed infants . In addition , the C. difficile counts were significantly lower in breast-fed infants than in the formula-fed group -LRB- median values of 3.28 log10 and 7.43 log10 CFU g -LRB- -1 -RRB- , respectively ; p = 0.03 -RRB- . The prevalence of E. coli in the breast-fed and formula-fed group was 80 % and 94 % , respectively . Also , the E. coli counts in colonized infants was significantly lower in the breast-fed infants than in the formula-fed group -LRB- median values of 9.11 log10 and 9.57 log10 CFU g -LRB- -1 -RRB- , respectively ; p = 0.004 -RRB- . We conclude that the prevalence and counts of C. difficile as well as E. coli are significantly lower in the gut microbiota of breast-fed infants than in that of formula-fed infants , whereas the prevalence and counts of Bifidobacterium spp. is similar among both groups . The development of the gut is controlled and modulated by different interacting mechanisms such as , genetic endowment , intrinsic biological regulatory functions , environment influences and last but no least , the diet influence . Considered together with other endogenous and exogenous factors the type of feeding may interfere greatly in the regulation of the intestinal microbiota . During the last years molecular methods offer a complementarity to the classic culture-based knowledge . FISH has been applied for molecular evaluation of the microbiota in newborns delivered by vaginal delivery . Eleven probes/probe combinations for specific groups of faecal bacteria were used to determine the bacterial composition in faecal samples of newborns infants under different types of feeding . Breast-fed infants harbor a fecal microbiota by more than two times increased in numbers of Bifidobacterium cells when compared to formula-fed infants . After formula-feeding , Atopobium was found in significant counts and the numbers of Bifidobacterium dropped followed by increasing numbers in Bacteroides population . Moreover , under formula feeding the infants microbiota was more diverse . An obvious difference between breast-fed and formula-fed newborn infants is the development of the intestinal flora , considered to be of importance for protection against harmful micro-organisms and for the maturation of the intestinal immune system . In this study , novel molecular identification methods were used to verify the data obtained by traditional culture methods and to validate the culture independent fluorescent in situ hybridization -LRB- FISH -RRB- technique . From each of six breast-fed and six formula-fed newborn infants , six fecal samples were obtained during the first 20 days of life . The microbial compositions of the samples were analyzed by culturing on specific media and by FISH , by using specific 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes . The colonies growing on the media were identified by random amplified polymorphic DNA pattern analysis and by polymerase chain reaction amplification and subsequent analysis of the 16S rRNA gene . Molecular identification of the colonies showed that the selective media are insufficiently selective and unsuitable for quantitative analyses . Qualitative information from the culturing results combined with the data obtained by the FISH technique revealed initial colonization in all infants of a complex -LRB- adult-like -RRB- flora . After this initial colonization , a selection of bacterial strains began in all infants , in which Bifidobacterium strains played an important role . In all breast-fed infants , bifidobacteria become dominant , whereas in most formula-fed infants similar amounts of Bacteroides and bifidobacteria -LRB- approximately 40 % -RRB- were found . The minor components of the fecal samples from breast-fed infants were mainly lactobacilli and streptococci ; samples from formula-fed infants often contained staphylococci , Escherichia coli , and clostridia . This study confirms the differences in development of intestinal flora between breast-fed and formula-fed infants . The results obtained from the FISH technique were consistent . Although the repertoire of probes for this study was not yet complete , the FISH technique will probably become the method of reference for future studies designed to develop breast-fed-like intestinal flora in formula-fed infants . The development of stool bacterial flora was studied in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants . In both groups of infants , the intestine was first colonized with enterobacteria and their number attained 10 -LRB- 9 -RRB- per gram of feces . On day 6 , bifidobacteria were the predominant organisms in the stool of breast-fed infants , exceeding enterobacteria by a ratio of 1,000:1 , whereas enterobacteria were the predominant organisms in formula-fed infants , exceeding bifidobacteria by approximately 10:1 . At 1 month of age , bifidobacteria were the most prevalent organisms in both groups but the number of these organisms in the stool of bottle-fed infants was approximately one tenth that of breast-fed infants . The properties of breast milk that promote the growth of bifidobacteria and suppress the growth of coliform and other potentially pathogenic organisms , theoretically , would help to minimize the incidence of neonatal diseases caused by these organisms . The results would support the advantages of breast-feeding for optimal care of newborn infants . In order to clarify the distribution of bifidobacterial species in the human intestinal tract , a 16S rRNA-gene-targeted species-specific PCR technique was developed and used with DNAs extracted from fecal samples obtained from 48 healthy adults and 27 breast-fed infants . To cover all of the bifidobacterial species that have been isolated from and identified in the human intestinal tract , species-specific primers for Bifidobacterium longum , B. infantis , B. dentium , and B. gallicum were developed and used with primers for B. adolescentis , B. angulatum , B. bifidum , B. breve , and the B. catenulatum group -LRB- B. catenulatum and B. pseudocatenulatum -RRB- that were developed in a previous study -LRB- T. Matsuki , K. Watanabe , R. Tanaka , and H. Oyaizu , FEMS Microbiol . Lett . 167:113-121 , 1998 -RRB- . The specificity of the nine primers was confirmed by PCR , and the species-specific PCR method was found to be a useful means for identifying Bifidobacterium strains isolated from human feces . The results of an examination of bifidobacterial species distribution showed that the B. catenulatum group was the most commonly found taxon -LRB- detected in 44 of 48 samples -LSB- 92 % -RSB- -RRB- , followed by B. longum and B. adolescentis , in the adult intestinal bifidobacterial flora and that B. breve , B. infantis , and B. longum were frequently found in the intestinal tracts of infants . The present study demonstrated that qualitative detection of the bifidobacterial species present in human feces can be accomplished rapidly and accurately . The establishment of the faecal flora of 39 full-term infants fed exclusively on breast milk -LRB- n = 20 -RRB- or with two different modern adapted cow 's milk formulas -LRB- n = 19 -RRB- was studied during the first 3 months of life . One formula investigated was based on 100 % bovine casein as the protein source whereas the other formula contained bovine milk proteins with a whey/casein ratio of 60:40 . A faecal flora rich in bifidobacteria was found in all study groups ; the growth of putrefactive bacteria -LRB- especially Bacteroides spp. -RRB- , however , was limited . In formula-fed infants , significantly higher bacterial counts of enterococci and clostridia were detected compared to breast milk-fed infants . Similarities and differences due to the feeding regimen were particularly reflected in the pattern of the anaerobic bacterial species . Bifidobacterium bifidum , B. infantis and B. breve constituted the majority of the bifidobacterial flora independent of the type of milk feeding . Other bifidobacterial species such as B. longum , B. adolescentis , B. parabifidum and B. pseudo-catenulatum were detected in high numbers and at low frequencies in breastfed infants . The latter three were observed in infants fed the whey/casein formula as well . It seems that infants fed a casein formula develop a faecal flora more like that of breastfed infants concerning Lactobacillus spp. -LRB- especially L. fermentum and L. brevis -RRB- . To determine the impact of 2 probiotic bifidobacteria on the fecal microbiota of premature infants fed either human milk or formula . In the first of two phase 1 clinical trials , 12 premature infants receiving formula feedings were assigned randomly to receive either Bifidobacterium longum ssp infantis or Bifidobacterium animalis ssp lactis in increasing doses during a 5-week period . In the second , 9 premature infants receiving their mother 's milk received each of the two bifidobacteria for 2 weeks separated by a 1-week washout period . Serial stool specimens from each infant were analyzed by terminal restriction fragment-length polymorphism and quantitative polymerase chain reaction for bacterial composition . Among the formula-fed infants , there was a greater increase in fecal bifidobacteria among infants receiving B infantis -LRB- Binf -RRB- than those receiving B lactis -LRB- Blac -RRB- . This difference was most marked at a dose of 1.4 × 10 -LRB- 9 -RRB- colony-forming units twice daily -LRB- P < .05 -RRB- . Bacterial diversity improved over dose/time in those infants receiving Binf . Among the human milk-fed infants , greater increases in fecal bifidobacteria and decreases in γ-Proteobacteria followed the administration of Binf than Blac . The B longum group -LRB- which includes Binf but not Blac -RRB- was the dominant bifidobacteria among the human milk-fed infants , regardless of the probiotic administered . Binf was more effective at colonizing the fecal microbiota than Blac in both formula-fed and human milk-fed premature infants . The combination of human milk plus Binf resulted in the greatest fecal levels of bifidobacteria . Most studies involving prebiotic oligosaccharides have been carried out using inulin and its fructo-oligosaccharide -LRB- FOS -RRB- derivatives , together with various forms of galacto-oligosaccharides -LRB- GOS -RRB- . Although many intestinal bacteria are able to grow on these carbohydrates , most investigations have demonstrated that the growth of bifidobacteria , and to a lesser degree lactobacilli , is particularly favoured . Because of their safety , stability , organoleptic properties , resistance to digestion in the upper bowel and fermentability in the colon , as well as their abilities to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut , these prebiotics are being increasingly incorporated into the Western diet . Inulin-derived oligosaccharides and GOS are mildly laxative , but can result in flatulence and osmotic diarrhoea if taken in large amounts . However , their effects on large bowel habit are relatively minor . Although the literature dealing with the health significance of prebiotics is not as extensive as that concerning probiotics , considerable evidence has accrued showing that consumption of GOS and FOS can have significant health benefits , particularly in relation to their putative anti-cancer properties , influence on mineral absorption , lipid metabolism , and anti-inflammatory and other immune effects such as atopic disease . In many instances , prebiotics seem to be more effective when used as part of a synbiotic combination . Oligosaccharides -LRB- OS -RRB- from bovine milk are a class of bioactive molecules that are receiving increasing commercial attention for their potential health benefits . In the present work we measured , comprehensively and systematically , free milk OS in the colostrum of 7 Holstein-Friesian cows during the first 3 d of lactation in 12-h intervals by HPLC-chip/time-of-flight mass spectrometry to determine the biological variation of free milk OS in early lactation . The high sensitivity and resolution of the analytical technique made it possible to monitor all OS species , thus providing a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of OS variations during colostrum production . This study confirmed that although sialyllactose is the major OS in bovine colostrum , several neutral OS species are present in significant abundance even at the third day of lactation . Furthermore , variation in terms of OS species and relative abundances of OS between cows suggest individual animal variation . These variations are likely due to genetic factors because environmental factors such as nutrition , lactation number , and accommodation were the same for all cows . This investigation revealed that colostrum milk from Holstein-Friesian cows is a rich source of neutral and acidic OS for the food and pharmaceutical industries . Human milk oligosaccharides -LRB- HMO -RRB- are believed to have a range of biological activities beyond providing nutrition to the infant . Principal among these is that they may act as prebiotics . Prebiotics are dietary ingredients , usually oligosaccharides that provide a health benefit to the host mediated by the modulation of the human gut microbiota . While it is clear that such oligosaccharides may have potential applications in infants and adults alike , this potential is limited by the difficulties in manufacturing HMO . Consequently functional alternatives such as galacto-oligosaccharides -LRB- GOS -RRB- are under investigation . GOS are produced enzymatically from lactose for commercial use in food applications -- including addition to infant formulae -- as similar to breast milk oligosaccharides , they encourage a gut bacteria population that promotes health and reduces the incidence of intestinal infections . New methods for separation and concentration of complex , breast milk-like oligosaccharides from bovine milk industrial streams that contain only low amounts of these valuable oligosaccharides are providing the opportunity to investigate other viable sources of specific oligosaccharides for use as prebiotics in supplements or food products . Bovine milk oligosaccharides have several potentially important biological activities including the prevention of pathogen binding to the intestinal epithelial and as nutrients for beneficial bacteria . It has been suggested that milk oligosaccharides are an important source of complex carbohydrates as supplements for the food and the pharmaceutical industries . However , only a small number of structures of bovine milk oligosaccharides -LRB- bMO -RRB- are known . There have been no systematic studies on bMO . High-performance mass spectrometry and separation methods are used to evaluate bMO , and nearly 40 oligosaccharides are present in bovine milk . Bovine milk oligosaccharides are composed of shorter oligomeric chains than are those in human milk . They are significantly more anionic with nearly 70 % , measured abundances , being sialylated . Additionally , bMO are built not only on the lactose core -LRB- as are nearly all human milk oligosaccharides -RRB- , but also on lactose amines . Sialic acid residues include both N-acetyl and N-glycolylneuraminic acid , although the former is significantly more abundant . Milk oligosaccharides -LRB- OS -RRB- are not only a source of nutrition for newborns , but also provide numerous important biological functions including the prevention of pathogen binding to the intestinal epithelium and serving as nutritive sources for beneficial bacteria . High-performance mass spectrometry and separation methods were used to evaluate changes of bovine milk oligosaccharides -LRB- bMO -RRB- in different lactation stages . Previously , 40 bMO were identified in bovine milk with many consisting of short oligomeric chains that were less complex than human milk oligosaccharides -LRB- hMO -RRB- . The bMO are also significantly more anionic than hMO , with nearly 70 % in measured abundances containing either N-acetylneuraminic acid or N-glycolylneuraminic acid , and no fucosylated OS . In this study , we examined factors that could affect the abundances of bMO including stage of lactation and breed . The total concentrations dropped rapidly in the first several days of lactation . Moreover , the anionic oligosaccharides -LRB- including N-glycolylneuraminic acid -RRB- decreased more rapidly compared with the neutral oligosaccharides . After validation of test-weighing procedures milk volumes produced by 13 multiparous Caucasian women were followed longitudinally through the first year of lactation . All practiced exclusive breast-feeding for at least 5 mo. . Milk transfer to the infant was low on days 1 and 2 and increased rapidly to 498 + / - 129 g/d -LRB- means + / - SD -RRB- on day 5 and then more slowly to 753 + / - 89 g/d during months 3-5 . There was a characteristic milk volume for each mother-infant pair that was significantly related neither to milk yield on days 4-6 nor to birth weight . It was , however , strongly related to infant weight at 1 mo , suggesting that infant and/or maternal factors coming into play during the first month of life are strong determinants of subsequent milk transfer to the infant . Factors related to milk volume and sources of variance in intake were examined using data at 3 months from the longitudinal Davis Area Research on Lactation , Infant Nutrition and Growth study . Milk intake of 73 exclusively breast-fed infants was measured by 4-day test-weighing , correcting for insensible water loss . Total volume extracted was assessed by a combination of test-weighing and expression of breast contents during a subsequent 24-hour period . Residual milk volume was calculated as volume extracted minus intake . The interindividual coefficient of variation in intake -LRB- 16.3 % -RRB- was greater than within-individual day-to-day variation -LRB- 8.9 % -RRB- . In comparing those with low -LRB- less than 650 g/d -RRB- vs average intake , there was no significant difference in residual milk volume between groups -LRB- 85 vs 111 g/d -RRB- , indicating that infants with low intakes left as much milk unconsumed as those with higher intakes . There were no differences between groups in maternal age , parity , or anthropometric indices . Infants with low intakes were smaller and spent less time nursing , even though their mothers reportedly nursed on demand . In linear regressions , none of the maternal variables was significantly correlated with intake , volume extracted , or residual milk volume . Infant birth weight , weight at 3 months , and total time nursing were positively associated with intake . The results suggest that infant demand is the main determinant of lactation performance in populations such as this . To develop an infant stool scale describing consistency , amount , and color and test its usefulness by assessing the differences between term and preterm infants , between breastfed and formula fed infants and examining interobserver and intraobserver variability . Information about gestational age , postnatal age , and feeding type was collected in relation to each photograph taken . An infant stool form scale describing consistency -LRB- 4-point scale -RRB- , amount -LRB- 4-point scale -RRB- , and color -LRB- 6 categories -RRB- was developed . All photographs were scored twice with the newly developed scale to assess interobserver and intraobserver variability . Consensus database describing stool characteristics was developed . A total of 555 photographs of infant stools were analyzed ; 60 -LRB- 11 % -RRB- of the infants studied were term , and 495 -LRB- 89 % -RRB- were born prematurely . No differences were found between preterm and term infants . Breastfed infants had smaller amounts of stools compared with formula-fed infants -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- . The interobserver weighed kappa value -LRB- 95 % CI -RRB- was good for consistency and amount ; the simple kappa value was good for color . For observers I and II intraobserver kappa values were excellent . This `` Amsterdam '' stool form scale is useful to assess defecation patterns in both premature and term born infants . Human milk oligosaccharides -LRB- HMOs -RRB- , as an abundant and bioactive component of breast milk , work in many ways to promote the health of breast fed infants . The expression of HMOs has been shown to vary in accordance with Lewis blood type and secretor status , as women of different blood types differ in the expression of α1 ,2 fucosyltransferase -LRB- FUT2 -RRB- and α1 ,3 / 4 fucosyltransferase -LRB- FUT3 -RRB- . In this study , HMOs were extracted from the milk of 60 women from The Gambia , Africa with various Lewis and secretor blood types . The HMOs were profiled using high resolution HPLC-Chip/TOF mass spectrometry . Notably , the amounts of fucosylation varied significantly between Le -LRB- a + b - -RRB- nonsecretors , Le -LRB- a-b + -RRB- and Le -LRB- a-b - -RRB- secretors , and Le -LRB- a-b - -RRB- nonsecretors . With higher frequency of expression of the recessive Lewis negative and nonsecretor phenotypes in West African populations , the HMO profiles of several milks from women of these phenotypes were examined , demonstrating decreased amounts of total oligosaccharide abundance and lower relative amounts of fucosylation . Also in this study , four specific fucosylated structures -LRB- 2 ` FL , LNFP I , LDFT , and LNDFH I -RRB- were determined to be specific and sensitive glycan markers for rapidly determining secretor status without the need for serological testing . Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria are increasingly being administered to pregnant women and infants with the intention of improving health . Although these organisms have a long record of safe use , it is important to identify any adverse effects in potentially vulnerable populations . In a randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial , we evaluated the safety of a bacterial dietary supplement for the prevention of atopy in infants . Two strains of lactobacilli -LRB- Lactobacillus salivarius CUL61 and Lactobacillus paracasei CUL08 -RRB- and bifidobacteria -LRB- Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CUL34 and Bifidobacterium bifidum CUL20 -RRB- with a total of 1 x 10 -LRB- 10 -RRB- colony-forming units were administered daily to women during the last month of pregnancy and to infants aged 0-6 mo. . Adverse events -LRB- AE -RRB- were classified according to WHO International Statistical Classification of Diseases criteria . Common symptoms were recorded by regular questionnaires . Baseline characteristics of 220 mother-infant dyads in the treatment and 234 in the placebo group were similar . Compliance with the trial interventions , loss to follow-up , symptoms , drug usage , infant growth , method of feeding , visits to the doctor , and mothers ' assessment of infant health were similar in the 2 groups . Fifteen -LRB- 6.8 % -RRB- mothers and 73 -LRB- 33.2 % -RRB- infants in the treatment group and 21 -LRB- 9.0 % -RRB- mothers and 75 -LRB- 32.1 % -RRB- infants in the placebo group reported AE -LRB- P = 0.49 and P = 0.84 , respectively -RRB- . Severe AE occurred in 18 mothers and 63 infants with a similar frequency in each group . None of the AE were attributed to the intervention . Our findings support the safe use of this consortium of organisms during pregnancy and early infancy . A limited number of nondigestible oligosaccharides are available for use in infant formula . This study evaluated growth and safety in infants fed formula supplemented with a mixture of bovine milk-derived oligosaccharides -LRB- BMOS -RRB- . This mixture , which was generated from whey permeate , contains galactooligosaccharides and other oligosaccharides from bovine milk , such as 3 ' - and 6 ' - sialyllactose . We hypothesized that growth in infants fed BMOS-supplemented formula would be noninferior to that in infants fed standard formula . Healthy term infants ≤ 14 days old were randomly assigned to standard formula -LRB- control ; n = 84 -RRB- ; standard formula with BMOS -LRB- IF-BMOS ; n = 99 -RRB- ; or standard formula with BMOS and probiotics -LRB- Bifidobacterium longum , Lactobacillus rhamnosus -RRB- -LRB- IF-BMOS + Pro ; n = 98 -RRB- . A breastfed reference group was also enrolled -LRB- n = 30 -RRB- . The primary outcome was mean weight gain/day from enrollment to age 4 months -LRB- noninferiority margin : -3.0 g/day -RRB- . 189 -LRB- 67.3 % -RRB- formula-fed infants were included in the primary analysis . Mean differences in weight gain between the control and IF-BMOS and IF-BMOS + Pro groups were < 1 g/day , with 97.5 % confidence intervals above -3.0 g/day , indicating noninferior weight gain in the BMOS formula groups . Compared with control , infants in the BMOS groups had more frequent -LRB- p < 0.0001 -RRB- and less hard -LRB- p = 0.0003 -RRB- stools . No significant differences were observed between the control and BMOS groups in caregivers ' reports of flatulence , vomiting , spitting up , crying , fussing , and colic . When based on clinical evaluation by the investigator , the incidence of colic was higher -LRB- p = 0.01 -RRB- in IF-BMOS than in control ; the incidence of investigator-diagnosed colic was not significantly different in control and IF-BMOS + Pro -LRB- p = 0.15 -RRB- . Stool bifidobacteria and lactobacilli counts were higher with IF-BMOS + Pro compared with control -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- , whereas Clostridia counts were lower -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- in both BMOS groups compared with control . Infant formula containing BMOS either with or without probiotics provides adequate nutrition for normal growth in healthy term infants . Further studies are needed to fully explore the digestive tolerance of BMOS formula . ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01886898 . Registered 24 June 2013 . To determine whether probiotic lactobacilli may alleviate small intestinal inflammation and strengthen the intestinal barrier function in children with atopic dermatitis . In a double-blinded , placebo-controlled , cross-over study , probiotic lactobacilli -LRB- Lactobacillus rhamnosus 19070-2 and L reuteri DSM 12246 -RRB- were administered for 6 weeks to 41 children with moderate and severe atopic dermatitis . Gastrointestinal symptoms were registered before and during treatment and small intestinal permeability was measured by the lactulose-mannitol test . During Lactobacillus supplementation , there was a significant decrease in the frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms -LRB- 39 % during the placebo period versus 10 % during active treatment , P = .002 -RRB- . There was a positive association between the lactulose to mannitol ratio and the severity of the eczema -LRB- r = 0.61 , P = .02 after placebo and r = 0.53 , P = .05 after active treatment -RRB- . After probiotic treatment , the lactulose to mannitol ratio was lower -LRB- 0.073 -RRB- than after placebo -LRB- 0.110 , P = .001 -RRB- . Impairment of the intestinal mucosal barrier appears to be involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis . The study suggests that probiotic supplementation may stabilize the intestinal barrier function and decrease gastrointestinal symptoms in children with atopic dermatitis . Probiotics and prebiotics are increasingly being added to foodstuffs with claims of health benefits . Probiotics are live microorganisms that are thought to have beneficial effects on the host , whereas prebiotics are ingredients that stimulate the growth and/or function of beneficial intestinal microorganisms . But can these products directly modulate immune function and influence inflammatory diseases ? Here , Nature Reviews Immunology asks four experts to discuss these issues and provide their thoughts on the future application of probiotics as a disease therapy . Probiotic bacteria have well-established beneficial effects in the management of diarrhoeal diseases . Newer evidence suggests that probiotics have the potential to reduce the risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases and intestinal bacterial overgrowth after gut surgery . In liver health , the main benefits of probiotics might occur through preventing the production and/or uptake of lipopolysaccharides in the gut , and therefore reducing levels of low-grade inflammation . Specific immune stimulation by probiotics through processes involving dendritic cells might also be beneficial to the host immunological status and help prevent pathogen translocation . Hepatic fat metabolism also seems to be influenced by the presence of commensal bacteria , and potentially by probiotics ; although the mechanisms by which probiotic might act on the liver are still unclear . However , this might be of major importance in the future because low-grade inflammation , hepatic fat infiltration , and hepatitis might become more prevalent as a result of high fat intake and the increased prevalence of obesity . Necrotizing enterocolitis -LRB- NEC -RRB- and nosocomial sepsis are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in preterm infants . Through prevention of bacterial migration across the mucosa , competitive exclusion of pathogenic bacteria , and enhancing the immune responses of the host , prophylactic enteral probiotics -LRB- live microbial supplements -RRB- may play a role in reducing NEC and associated morbidity . To compare the efficacy and safety of prophylactic enteral probiotics administration versus placebo or no treatment in the prevention of severe NEC and/or sepsis in preterm infants . For this update , searches were made of MEDLINE -LRB- 1966 to October 2010 -RRB- , EMBASE -LRB- 1980 to October 2010 -RRB- , the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials -LRB- CENTRAL , The Cochrane Library , Issue 2 , 2010 -RRB- , and abstracts of annual meetings of the Society for Pediatric Research -LRB- 1995 to 2010 -RRB- . Only randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that enrolled preterm infants < 37 weeks gestational age and/or < 2500 g birth weight were considered . Trials were included if they involved enteral administration of any live microbial supplement -LRB- probiotics -RRB- and measured at least one prespecified clinical outcome . Standard methods of the Cochrane Collaboration and its Neonatal Group were used to assess the methodologic quality of the trials , data collection and analysis . Sixteen eligible trials randomizing 2842 infants were included . Included trials were highly variable with regard to enrollment criteria -LRB- i.e. birth weight and gestational age -RRB- , baseline risk of NEC in the control groups , timing , dose , formulation of the probiotics , and feeding regimens . Data regarding extremely low birth weight infants -LRB- ELBW -RRB- could not be extrapolated . In a meta-analysis of trial data , enteral probiotics supplementation significantly reduced the incidence of severe NEC -LRB- stage II or more -RRB- -LRB- typical RR 0.35 , 95 % CI 0.24 to 0.52 -RRB- and mortality -LRB- typical RR 0.40 , 95 % CI 0.27 to 0.60 -RRB- . There was no evidence of significant reduction of nosocomial sepsis -LRB- typical RR 0.90 , 95 % CI 0.76 to 1.07 -RRB- . The included trials reported no systemic infection with the probiotics supplemental organism . The statistical test of heterogeneity for NEC , mortality and sepsis was insignificant . Enteral supplementation of probiotics prevents severe NEC and all cause mortality in preterm infants . Our updated review of available evidence supports a change in practice . More studies are needed to assess efficacy in ELBW infants and assess the most effective formulation and dose to be utilized . The study of probiotics to prevent allergic conditions has yielded conflicting results in children . We undertook a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate whether probiotic use during pregnancy and early life decreases the incidence of atopic dermatitis and immunoglobulin E -LRB- IgE -RRB- - associated atopic dermatitis in infants and young children . We performed a systematic literature search in Medline , Embase , and Cochrane Library , updated to October 2011 . The intervention was diet supplementation with probiotics versus placebo . Primary outcomes were incidence of atopic dermatitis and IgE-associated atopic dermatitis . We calculated summary relative risks -LRB- RRs -RRB- and corresponding 95 % confidence intervals -LRB- CIs -RRB- , using both fixed - and random-effects models . We computed summary estimates across several strata , including study period , type of patient , dose , and duration of intervention , and we assessed the risk of bias within and across trials . We identified 18 publications based on 14 studies . Meta-analysis demonstrated that probiotic use decreased the incidence of atopic dermatitis -LRB- RR = 0.79 -LSB- 95 % CI = 0.71-0.88 -RSB- -RRB- . Studies were fairly homogeneous -LRB- I = 24.0 % -RRB- . The corresponding RR of IgE-associated atopic dermatitis was 0.80 -LRB- 95 % CI = 0.66-0.96 -RRB- . No appreciable difference emerged across strata , nor was there evidence of publication bias . This meta-analysis provided evidence in support of a moderate role of probiotics in the prevention of atopic dermatitis and IgE-associated atopic dermatitis in infants . The favorable effect was similar regardless of the time of probiotic use -LRB- pregnancy or early life -RRB- or the subject -LRB- s -RRB- receiving probiotics -LRB- mother , child , or both -RRB- . Probiotics are living microorganisms that , when consumed , have the potential to confer a beneficial health effect . Unfortunately for purveyors of probiotic products , the system of regulation delineated in the Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act is anything but `` one size fits all . '' How a probiotic product is used or is intended to be used will govern the regulatory category or categories that the US Food and Drug Administration -LRB- FDA -RRB- will assign to the product . The extent and nature of the restraints and data-collection requirements that may be imposed on the marketing of a product hinge on how a product is categorized under the Act . More specifically , the categorization of a product governs the respective regulatory burdens of an industry sponsor and the FDA . Premarket systems , such as those for new drugs and biologics , place a heavy evidentiary burden on the sponsor of a product . Postmarket systems , such as those for dietary supplements , place , at least initially , a higher regulatory evidentiary burden on the FDA than on the product sponsor . This article explains regulatory categorizations under the Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act and their effects regarding the federal regulation of probiotic products .	In the analysis to childhood studies , this heterogeneity was markedly decreased -LRB- I -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 32 % -RRB- and no longer attained statistical significance -LRB- P = 0.08 -RRB- . There was no association between cesarean delivery and the risk of asthma in children delivered by cesarean delivery -LRB- OR = 0.43 , 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , seven studies -RRB- , whereas a significant reduction in cesarean delivery . In addition , we found a systematic literature on the association in cesarean rhinitis , and atopic dermatitis and atopic diseases . This should be considered when cesarean section is done , 1966 to May 2007 , and perhaps food allergy/food atopy , but may have an increased risk of developing asthma under the countries . Furthermore , effect estimates for allergic sensitization defined as at least one specific IgE > / = 0.70 kU/l against any allergen -LSB- 1.48 -LRB- 0.98-2.24 -RRB- -RSB- , and against inhalant allergens -LSB- 1.75 -LRB- 0.80-2.44 -RRB- -RSB- during the first 2 yr of life -LRB- OR 1.06 , 1.05-1.32 ; six studies -RRB- and allergic rhinitis -LRB- OR 1.23 , 95 mg/day CI 0.98-1.09 ; seven studies .
24	positive	none	none	none	The application time of therapeutic ultrasound is an infrequently studied dosimetric variable that affects tissue repair . The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different treatment times of therapeutic ultrasound -LRB- US -RRB- on the organization of collagen fibers in the tendons of rats . Forty Wistar rats were selected -LRB- 300 ± 45 g -RRB- , and the rats were divided into five groups -LRB- n = 8 for each group -RRB- : Control , without tenotomy or any treatment ; tenotomy group , with tenotomy and without treatment ; US groups -LRB- US1 , US2 , and US3 -RRB- , subjected to tenotomy and treated with US for one , two , or three minutes per area of the transducer , respectively . The animals were sacrificed on the 12th post-operative day , and the tendons were surgically removed for analyses of the collagen fiber organization by means of birefringence analysis . The collagen fibers exhibited better aggregation and organization in the US3 group compared with the tenotomy group -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- . The findings suggest that US applied for three minutes per treated area improves the organization of collagen fibers during rat tendon repair . To determine the rate and magnitude of temperature change in response to ultrasound in human patellar tendon for two treatment sizes . A thermistor was inserted into the medial aspect of each subject 's right patellar tendon , and the baseline temperature was recorded . Using stratified random sampling and using a transducer head with an effective radiating area -LRB- ERA -RRB- of 4.5 cm -LRB- 2 -RRB- , we had eight subjects each undergo either the 2-or 4-ERA ultrasound treatment first . Each subject received a 3-MHz continuous ultrasound treatment at 1 W/cm -LRB- 2 -RRB- for both the 2-and 4-ERA treatment sizes . Sixteen subjects -LRB- 8 males , 21.3 + / - 1.9 years , and 8 females , 21.0 + / - 2.8 years -RRB- participated . We moved the sound head at a speed of 2 to 3 cm/sec while recording the tendon temperature every 30 seconds during , and for 20 minutes after , the 4-minute treatment . Twenty minutes after the treatment , we applied the second treatment to the other ERA treatment size . At the end of the treatment , the mean temperature increase was significantly different -LRB- P = .006 -RRB- between treatment sizes -LRB- 8.3 degrees C + / - 1.7 degrees C -LRB- 2 x ERA -RRB- and 5.0 degrees C + / - 1.0 degrees C -LRB- 4 x ERA -RRB- -RRB- . The rate of increase was also significantly different -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- . The heating rate per minute for the 2-ERA treatment was 2.1 degrees C + / - 0.4 degrees C and 1.3 degrees C + / - 0.3 degrees C for the 4-ERA treatment . There was a significant difference in the cooling between treatment sizes -LRB- P = .001 -RRB- . The rate of temperature decrease between treatment sizes was significantly different only during the first 5-minute interval post-treatment . Three-megahertz ultrasound at an intensity of 1 W/cm -LRB- 2 -RRB- significantly increased patellar tendon temperature at both 2 and 4 x ERA , but our results confirm that the 2-ERA treatment size provided higher and longer heating than the 4-ERA treatment size . Researchers have recommended certain ultrasound treatment parameters for deep heating ; however , we observed different parameters in the clinical setting . To compare the treatment effect of using observed clinical parameters -LRB- OCP -RRB- from 8 clinicians to the treatment effect of using the recommended parameters -LRB- RP -RRB- sited in research . 2 x 2 repeated measures design . Sports injury research laboratory . Ten healthy volunteers . Two 1 MHz treatment , 1 RP treatment -LRB- 1.5 W/cm2 , 10-min , area-2 to 3 x ERA -RRB- , and 1 OCP treatment -LRB- 1.3 W/cm2 , 8-min , area 3.9 X ERA -RRB- . Tricep surae temperature 3 cm below superficial tissue . The RP treatment increase temperature from 36.4 + / - 1.0 to 40.3 + / - 2.0 degrees C , which was a greater change than the OCP -LRB- 36.5 + / - 1.2 to 38.2 + / - 1.6 degrees C -RRB- . The OCP treatment resulted in a lower heating affect than the RP . Small change in treatment area , intensity , and duration can have a large effect on temperature change . To achieve the thermal effects of ultrasound , the tissue temperature must be raised from 1 to > or = 4 degrees C , depending on the desired outcome of the treatment . In the past 25 years , there have been no in vivo studies that have measured rate of change in temperature during 1-MHz ultrasound treatments , and none have ever been performed with the 3-MHz frequency . Thus , we are left to pure speculation regarding how long to administer an ultrasound treatment . We performed this study to plot the rate of temperature increase during ultrasound treatments delivered at various intensities and frequencies . We inserted two 23-gauge thermistors into each subjects ' medial triceps surae at the following depths : 1 MHz at depths of 2.5 and 5.0 cm -LRB- 12 subjects -RRB- and 3 MHz at depths of .8 and 1.6 cm -LRB- 12 subjects -RRB- . Each subject received a total of four 10-minute treatments , one each at .5 , 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 W/cm2 , and temperature was measured every 30 seconds . No significant difference was found in the rate of heating at the two depths -LRB- p = .987 -RRB- within the same frequency and dose levels . The 3-MHz frequency heated significantly faster than the 1-MHz frequency at all doses tested -LRB- p < .001 -RRB- . On average , the rate of temperature increased per minute at the two depths of the 1-MHz frequency was : .04 degrees C at .5 W/cm2 ; .16 degrees C at 1.0 W/cm2 ; .33 degrees C at 1.5 W/cm2 ; and .38 degrees C at 2.0 W/cm2 . The rate of temperature increase per minute at the two depths of the 3-MHz frequency was : .3 degrees C at .5 W/cm2 ; .58 degrees C at 1.0 W/cm2 ; .89 degrees C at 1.5 W/cm2 ; and 1.4 degrees C at 2.0 W/cm2 . The results of this research should enable clinicians to choose the correct frequency , intensity , and treatment time when using thermal ultrasound . Piezoelectric films have recently attracted considerable attention in the development of various sensor and actuator devices such as nonvolatile memories , tunable microwave circuits and ultrasound transducers . In this paper , an overview of the state of art in piezoelectric films for high frequency transducer applications is presented . Firstly , the basic principles of piezoelectric materials and design considerations for ultrasound transducers will be introduced . Following the review , the current status of the piezoelectric films and recent progress in the development of high frequency ultrasonic transducers will be discussed . Then details for preparation and structure of the materials derived from piezoelectric thick film technologies will be described . Both chemical and physical methods are included in the discussion , namely , the sol-gel approach , aerosol technology and hydrothermal method . The electric and piezoelectric properties of the piezoelectric films , which are very important for transducer applications , such as permittivity and electromechanical coupling factor , are also addressed . Finally , the recent developments in the high frequency transducers and arrays with piezoelectric ZnO and PZT thick film using MEMS technology are presented . In addition , current problems and further direction of the piezoelectric films for very high frequency ultrasound application -LRB- up to GHz -RRB- are also discussed . Therapeutic applications of ultrasound predate its use in imaging . A range of biological effects can be induced by ultrasound , depending on the exposure levels used . At low levels , beneficial , reversible cellular effects may be produced , whereas at high intensities instantaneous cell death is sought . Therapy ultrasound can therefore be broadly divided into `` low power '' and `` high power '' applications . The `` low power '' group includes physiotherapy , fracture repair , sonophoresis , sonoporation and gene therapy , whereas the most common use of `` high power '' ultrasound in medicine is probably now high intensity focused ultrasound . Therapeutic effect through the intensity spectrum is obtained by both thermal and non-thermal interaction mechanisms . At low intensities , acoustic streaming is likely to be significant , but at higher levels , heating and acoustic cavitation will predominate . While useful therapeutic effects are now being demonstrated clinically , the mechanisms by which they occur are often not well understood . Ultrasonography -LRB- US -RRB- has been used in medical imaging for over half a century . Current US scanners are based largely on the same basic principles used in the initial devices for human imaging . Modern equipment uses a pulse-echo approach with a brightness-mode -LRB- B-mode -RRB- display . Fundamental aspects of the B-mode imaging process include basic ultrasound physics , interactions of ultrasound with tissue , ultrasound pulse formation , scanning the ultrasound beam , and echo detection and signal processing . Recent technical innovations that have been developed to improve the performance of modern US equipment include the following : tissue harmonic imaging , spatial compound imaging , extended field of view imaging , coded pulse excitation , electronic section focusing , three-dimensional and four-dimensional imaging , and the general trend toward equipment miniaturization . US is a relatively inexpensive , portable , safe , and real-time modality , all of which make it one of the most widely used imaging modalities in medicine . Although B-mode US is sometimes referred to as a mature technology , this modality continues to experience a significant evolution in capability with even more exciting developments on the horizon . One benefit of ultrasound over infrared modalities is its ability to penetrate subcutaneous fat . The purpose of this study was to compare tissue temperature rise during ultrasound treatments in humans with various thicknesses of subcutaneous fat in the medial gastrocnemius . Twenty males served as subjects . A 23-gauge hypodermic needle microprobe was inserted 3-cm deep into the medial portion of the anesthetized gastrocnemius , and connected to a thermocouple temperature gauge . We applied 15 ml of ultrasound gel , preheated to body temperature -LRB- 37 degrees C -RRB- , to a 10-cm-diameter target area . Continuous ultrasound was delivered topically at 1.5 W/cm -LRB- 2 -RRB- for 10 minutes . During this time , the soundhead was moved at a speed of 4 cm per second , and the temperature was recorded every 30 seconds . The mean baseline temperature for all subjects was 35.4 degrees C . The mean temperature increase was 4.9 degrees C . We performed a regression analysis to test for correlation between fat thickness and tissue temperature rise of subjects . There was a small positive but insignificant correlation -LRB- r = .128 -RRB- . This supports the claim of Grotthus and Draper . Since subcutaneous fat does not serve as a barrier to therapeutic ultrasound , athletic trainers and physical therapists can expect comparable increases in muscle temperature when using this modality on people with varying thicknesses of adipose tissue . This paper is based on material presented at the start of a Health Protection Agency meeting on ultrasound and infrasound . In answering the question ` what is ultrasound ? ' , it shows that the simple description of a wave which transports mechanical energy through the local vibration of particles at frequencies of 20 kHz or more , with no net transport of the particles themselves , can in every respect be misleading or even incorrect . To explain the complexities responsible for this , the description of ultrasound is first built up from the fundamental properties of these local particle vibrations . This progresses through an exposition of the characteristics of linear waves , in order to explain the propensity for , and properties of , the nonlinear propagation which occurs in many practical ultrasonic fields . Given the Health Protection environment which framed the original presentation , explanation and examples are given of how these complexities affect issues of practical importance . These issues include the measurement and description of fields and exposures , and the ability of ultrasound to affect tissue -LRB- through microstreaming , streaming , cavitation , heating , etc. -RRB- . It is noted that there are two very distinct regimes , in terms of wave characteristics and potential for bioeffect . The first concerns the use of ultrasound in liquids/solids , for measurement or material processing . For biomedical applications -LRB- where these two processes are termed diagnosis and therapy , respectively -RRB- , the issue of hazard has been studied in depth , although this has not been done to such a degree for industrial uses of ultrasound in liquids/solids -LRB- sonar , non-destructive testing , ultrasonic processing etc. -RRB- . However , in the second regime , that of the use of ultrasound in air , although the waves in question tend to be of much lower intensities than those used in liquids/solids , there is a greater mismatch between the extent to which hazard has been studied , and the growth in commercial applications for airborne ultrasound . A regulatory performance standard for ultrasound therapy equipment has been published by the Bureau of Radiological Health under the authority of The Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 . To clarify this standard and its intents , a number of topics relevant to the use of ultrasound in physical therapy are discussed , including the physics of ultrasound , equipment output measurements , and the harmful biological effects of ultrasound . The basic physical characteristics of ultrasound waves are reviewed in terms of the typical displacements , velocities , accelerations and pressures generated in various fluid media as a function of frequency . The effects on wave propagation of interfaces are considered , and the way in which waves are reflected , transmitted and mode converted at interfaces introduced . Then the nonlinear propagation of high amplitude ultrasound is explained , and its consequences , including the generation of harmonic frequencies and enhanced attenuation , considered . The absorption of ultrasonic waves and the resulting heat deposition in absorbing media are described together with factors determining the resulting temperature rises obtained . In the case of tissue these include conduction and perfusion . The characteristics of cavitation in fluid media are also briefly covered . Finally , secondary nonlinear physical effects are described . These include radiation forces on interfaces and streaming in fluids . Ultrasonic biophysics is the study of mechanisms responsible for how ultrasound and biological materials interact . Ultrasound-induced bioeffect or risk studies focus on issues related to the effects of ultrasound on biological materials . On the other hand , when biological materials affect the ultrasonic wave , this can be viewed as the basis for diagnostic ultrasound . Thus , an understanding of the interaction of ultrasound with tissue provides the scientific basis for image production and risk assessment . Relative to the bioeffect or risk studies , that is , the biophysical mechanisms by which ultrasound affects biological materials , ultrasound-induced bioeffects are generally separated into thermal and non-thermal mechanisms . Ultrasonic dosimetry is concerned with the quantitative determination of ultrasonic energy interaction with biological materials . Whenever ultrasonic energy is propagated into an attenuating material such as tissue , the amplitude of the wave decreases with distance . This attenuation is due to either absorption or scattering . Absorption is a mechanism that represents that portion of ultrasonic wave that is converted into heat , and scattering can be thought of as that portion of the wave , which changes direction . Because the medium can absorb energy to produce heat , a temperature rise may occur as long as the rate of heat production is greater than the rate of heat removal . Current interest with thermally mediated ultrasound-induced bioeffects has focused on the thermal isoeffect concept . The non-thermal mechanism that has received the most attention is acoustically generated cavitation wherein ultrasonic energy by cavitation bubbles is concentrated . Acoustic cavitation , in a broad sense , refers to ultrasonically induced bubble activity occurring in a biological material that contains pre-existing gaseous inclusions . Cavitation-related mechanisms include radiation force , microstreaming , shock waves , free radicals , microjets and strain . It is more challenging to deduce the causes of mechanical effects in tissues that do not contain gas bodies . These ultrasonic biophysics mechanisms will be discussed in the context of diagnostic ultrasound exposure risk concerns . Patients with hip osteoarthritis demonstrate limited range of motion , muscle weakness , and altered biomechanics ; however , few studies have evaluated the relationships between physical impairments and movement asymmetries . The purpose of this study was to identify the physical impairments related to movement abnormalities in patients awaiting total hip arthroplasty . We hypothesized that muscle weakness and pain would be related to greater movement asymmetries . Fifty-six subjects who were awaiting total hip arthroplasty were enrolled . Pain was assessed using a 0-10 scale , range of motion was assessed with the Harris Hip Score and isometric hip abductor strength was tested using a hand-held dynamometer . Trunk , pelvis and hip angles and moments in the frontal and sagittal planes were measured during walking using three dimensional motion analysis . During gait , subjects had 3.49 degrees less peak hip flexion and 8.82 degrees less extension angles -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- and had 0.03 Nm/k * m less hip adduction moment on the affected side -LRB- p = 0.043 -RRB- . Weaker hip muscles were related to greater pelvis -LRB- r = -0.291 -RRB- and trunk -LRB- r = -0.332 -RRB- rotations in the frontal plane . These findings suggest that hip weakness drives abnormal movement patterns at the pelvis and trunk in patients with hip osteoarthritis to a greater degree than hip pain . Existent biomechanical studies on hip osteoarthritic gait have primarily focused on the end stage of disease . Consequently , there is no clear consensus on which specific gait parameters are of most relevance for hip osteoarthritis patients with mild to moderate symptoms . The purpose of this study was to explore sagittal plane gait characteristics during the stance phase of gait in hip osteoarthritis patients not eligible for hip replacement surgery . First , compared to healthy controls , and second , when categorized into two subgroups of radiographic severity defined from a minimal joint space of ≤ / > 2 mm . Sagittal plane kinematics and kinetics of the hip , knee and ankle joint were calculated for total joint excursion throughout the stance phase , as well as from the specific events initial contact , midstance , peak hip extension and toe-off following 3D gait analysis . In addition , the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index , passive hip range of motion , and isokinetic muscle strength of hip and knee flexion and extension were included as secondary outcomes . Data were checked for normality and differences evaluated with the independent Student 's t-test , Welch 's t-test and the independent Mann-Whitney U-test . A binary logistic regression model was used in order to control for velocity in key variables . Fourty-eight hip osteoarthritis patients and 22 controls were included in the final material . The patients walked significantly slower than the controls -LRB- p = 0.002 -RRB- , revealed significantly reduced joint excursions of the hip -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- and knee -LRB- p = 0.011 -RRB- , and a reduced hip flexion moment at midstance and peak hip extension -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- . Differences were primarily manifested during the latter 50 % of stance , and were persistent when controlling for velocity . Subgroup analyses of patients with minimal joint space ≤ / > 2 mm suggested that the observed deviations were more pronounced in patients with greater radiographic severity . The biomechanical differences were , however , not reflected in self-reported symptoms or function . Reduced gait velocity , reduced sagittal plane joint excursion , and a reduced hip flexion moment in the late stance phase of gait were found to be evident already in hip osteoarthritis patients with mild to moderate symptoms , not eligible for total hip replacement . Consequently , these variables should be considered as key features in studies regarding hip osteoarthritic gait at all stages of disease . Subgroup analyses of patients with different levels of radiographic OA further generated the hypothesis that the observed characteristics were more pronounced in patients with a minimal joint space ≤ 2 mm . Physical disability -LRB- PD -RRB- is common among patients with osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- of the hip . Exercise therapy is proposed to be a potential intervention to reduce PD . However , the optimal targets of an exercise program are not known . The aim of the present study was to identify factors that explain the level of self-reported PD in patients with hip OA . Knowledge of these factors will help develop specific and effective exercise programs . Data from 149 patients with hip OA -LRB- 85 men and 64 women -RRB- were analyzed . Self-reported PD was quantified using the physical function subscale of the Western Ontario and McMaster index . A stepwise regression analysis was conducted to identify significant factors associated with self-reported PD . Stiffness , pain , and hip muscle strength were found to be significant factors related to the level of self-reported PD in hip OA . These factors explained 59 % -LRB- r adjusted = 0.59 -RRB- of the variance . Body mass index , gender , age , and passive internal hip rotation and flexion range of motion explained only minor parts of the dependent variable self-reported PD . Stiffness , pain , and hip muscle strength are associated with self-reported PD in hip OA . It is imperative that exercise treatments for hip OA include strategies to modify these factors . Further research should evaluate their role in preventing hip OA . Almost 2 decades ago , it was pointed out that physical therapists tended to overlook the tenuous nature of the scientific basis for the use of therapeutic ultrasound . The purpose of this review is to examine the literature regarding the biophysical effects of therapeutic ultrasound to determine whether these effects may be considered sufficient to provide a reason -LRB- biological rationale -RRB- for the use of insonation for the treatment of people with pain and soft tissue injury . This review does not discuss articles that examined the clinical usefulness of ultrasound -LRB- see article by Robertson and Baker titled `` A Review of Therapeutic Ultrasound : Effectiveness Studies '' in this issue -RRB- . The frequently described biophysical effects of ultrasound either do not occur in vivo under therapeutic conditions or have not been proven to have a clinical effect under these conditions . This review reveals that there is currently insufficient biophysical evidence to provide a scientific foundation for the clinical use of therapeutic ultrasound for the treatment of people with pain and soft tissue injury . To define and contrast multiple joint radiographic osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- phenotypes describing hand and whole-body radiographic OA among African Americans and Caucasians . We conducted a cross-sectional analysis in the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project , using radiographic data for the hands , tibiofemoral -LRB- TF -RRB- joints , patellofemoral joints , hips , and lumbosacral -LRB- LS -RRB- spine . Radiographs were read for OA by a single radiologist using standard atlases . Fisher 's exact test , with correction for multiple comparisons , was used to compare phenotype frequencies by race and sex . Logistic regression was used to provide odds ratios , which were adjusted for sex , age , and body mass index -LRB- BMI -RRB- . Sixteen mutually exclusive hand -LRB- n = 2,083 -RRB- and 32 whole-body -LRB- n = 1,419 -RRB- radiographic OA phenotypes were identified . We found that in comparison to Caucasians , African Americans had significantly less frequent radiographic OA of the distal interphalangeal joints , both in isolation and in combination with other hand joint sites , but had comparable frequencies of radiographic OA for other hand joint sites . Moreover , African Americans had less frequent radiographic OA of the hand , both in isolation and in combination with other joint sites , as compared to Caucasians . In contrast , African Americans had more than twice the odds of isolated OA of the TF joint and 77 % higher odds of radiographic OA of the TF joint and LS spine together as compared to Caucasians . Even after adjustment for sex , age , and BMI , African Americans were less likely than Caucasians to have hand radiographic OA phenotypes , but more likely to have knee radiographic OA phenotypes involving the TF joint . African Americans may have a higher burden of multiple large-joint OA involvement not captured by most definitions of `` generalized OA . '' The occurrence of knee osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- increases with age and is more common in women compared with men , especially after the age of 50 years . Recent work suggests that contact stress in the knee cartilage is a significant predictor of the risk for developing knee OA . Significant gaps in knowledge remain , however , as to how changes in musculoskeletal traits disturb the normal mechanical environment of the knee and contribute to sex differences in the initiation and progression of idiopathic knee OA . To illustrate this knowledge deficit , we summarize what is known about the influence of limb alignment , muscle function , and obesity on sex differences in knee OA . Observational data suggest that limb alignment can predict the development of radiographic signs of knee OA , potentially due to increased stresses and strains within the joint . However , these data do not indicate how limb alignment could contribute to sex differences in either the development or worsening of knee OA . Similarly , the strength of the knee extensor muscles is compromised in women who develop radiographic and symptomatic signs of knee OA , but the extent to which the decline in muscle function precedes the development of the disease is uncertain . Even less is known about how changes in muscle function might contribute to the worsening of knee OA . Conversely , obesity is a stronger predictor of developing knee OA symptoms in women than in men . The influence of obesity on developing knee OA symptoms is not associated with deviation in limb alignment , but BMI predicts the worsening of the symptoms only in individuals with neutral and valgus -LRB- knock-kneed -RRB- knees . It is more likely , however , that obesity modulates OA through a combination of systemic effects , particularly an increase in inflammatory cytokines , and mechanical factors within the joint . The absence of strong associations of these surrogate measures of the mechanical environment in the knee joint with sex differences in the development and progression of knee OA suggests that a more multifactorial and integrative approach in the study of this disease is needed . We identify gaps in knowledge related to mechanical influences on the sex differences in knee OA . Hip and knee osteoarthritis are common , chronic , and disabling . Therapeutic exercise is a component of all major rheumatologic society guidelines , yet the frequency , dose , duration , and therapeutic threshold for exercise are not clearly delineated . This review summarizes current studies of exercise for hip and knee osteoarthritis , discusses issues that influence the design , interpretation , and aggregation of results and how these factors impact the translation of data into clinical practice . A review of databases to identify current randomized controlled trials -LRB- 2000 to present -RRB- of exercise to manage the symptoms of hip and knee osteoarthritis is discussed here . One study enrolling only hip patients was identified . Six studies of outcomes for individuals with hip or knee osteoarthritis and 11 studies of persons with knee osteoarthritis were found . Limited studies focus specifically on exercise for persons with hip osteoarthritis . Exercise is provided as a complex intervention combining multiple modes and provided in various settings under a range of conditions . Regardless of the variability in results and inherent biases in trials , exercise appears to reduce pain and improve function for persons with knee osteoarthritis and provide pain relief for persons with hip osteoarthritis . Given the complexity of exercise interventions and the specific issues related to study design , novel approaches to the evaluation of exercise are warranted . This review focuses on the new perspectives which can provide insight into the crucial pathways that drive cartilage-bone physiopathology . In particular , we discuss the critical signaling and effector molecules that can activate cellular and molecular processes in both cartilage and bone cells and which may be relevant in cross talk among joint compartments : growth factors -LRB- bone morphogenetic proteins and transforming growth factor -RRB- , hypoxia-related factors , cell-matrix interactions -LSB- discoidin domain receptor 2 -LRB- DDR2 -RRB- and syndecan 4 -RSB- , signaling molecules -LSB- WNT , Hedgehog -LRB- Hh -RRB- -RSB- . With the continuous progression of our knowledge on the molecular pathways involved in cartilage and bone changes in osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- , an increasing number of potentially effective candidates for OA therapy are already under scrutiny in clinical trials to ascertain their possible safe use in an attempt to identify molecules active in slowing or halting OA progression and reducing joint pain . We then review the principal molecules currently under clinical investigation . Osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- is the most common cause of chronic disability in older adults . Although classically considered a `` wear and tear '' degenerative condition of articular joints , recent studies have demonstrated an inflammatory component to OA that includes increased activity of several cytokines and chemokines in joint tissues that drive production of matrix-degrading enzymes . Rather than directly causing OA , aging changes in the musculoskeletal system contribute to the development of OA by making the joint more susceptible to the effects of other OA risk factors that include abnormal biomechanics , joint injury , genetics , and obesity . Understanding the basic mechanisms by which aging affects joint tissues should provide new targets for slowing or preventing the development of OA . Osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- is a chronic joint disease with the hip and knee being commonly affected lower limb sites . Osteoarthritis causes pain , stiffness , swelling , joint instability and muscle weakness , all of which can lead to impaired physical function and reduced quality of life . This review of evidence provides recommendations for exercise prescription in those with hip or knee OA . A narrative review was performed . Conservative non-pharmacological strategies , particularly exercise , are recommended by all clinical guidelines for the management of OA and meta-analyses support these exercise recommendations . Aerobic , strengthening , aquatic and Tai chi exercise are beneficial for improving pain and function in people with OA with benefits seen across the range of disease severities . The optimal exercise dosage is yet to be determined and an individualized approach to exercise prescription is required based on an assessment of impairments , patient preference , co-morbidities and accessibility . Maximising adherence is a key element dictating success of exercise therapy . This can be enhanced by the use of supervised exercise sessions -LRB- possibly in class format -RRB- in the initial exercise period followed by home exercises . Bringing patients back for intermittent consultations with the exercise practitioner , or attendance at `` refresher '' group exercise classes may also assist long-term adherence and improved patient outcomes . Few studies have evaluated the effects of exercise on structural disease progression and there is currently no evidence to show that exercise can be disease modifying . Exercise plays an important role in managing symptoms in those with hip and knee OA . To assess the efficacy of ultrasound therapy -LRB- US -RRB- for decreasing pain and improving physical function , patient-perception of disease severity , and cartilage repair in people with knee osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- . We conducted a systematic review -LRB- to February 2009 -RRB- without language limits in MEDLINE , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , LILACS , MEDCARIB , CINAHL , PEDro , SPORT-discus , REHABDATA , and World Health Organization Clinical Trial Registry . We included randomized controlled trials of people with knee OA comparing the outcomes of interest for those receiving US with those receiving no US . Two reviewers independently selected studies , extracted relevant data and assessed quality . Pooled analyses were conducted using inverse-variance random effects models . Six small trials -LRB- 378 patients -RRB- were included . US improves pain -LSB- Standardized Mean Difference -LRB- SMD -RRB- -LRB- 95 % confidence interval -LRB- CI -RRB- -RRB- = -0.49 -LRB- -0.79 , -0.18 -RRB- , P = 0.002 -RSB- , and tends to improve self-reported physical function -LSB- SMD -LRB- CI -RRB- = -0.54 -LRB- -1.19 , 0.12 -RRB- , P = 0.11 -RSB- along with walking performance -LSB- SMD -LRB- CI -RRB- = 0.81 -LRB- -0.09 , 1.72 -RRB- , P = 0.08 -RSB- . Results from two trials -LRB- 128 patients -RRB- , conducted by the same group , show a positive effect of US on pain -LSB- SMD -LRB- CI -RRB- = -0.77 -LRB- -1.15 , -0.39 -RRB- , P < 0.001 -RSB- , self-reported physical function -LSB- SMD -LRB- CI -RRB- = -1.25 -LRB- -1.69 , -0.81 -RRB- , P < 0.001 -RSB- , and walking performance -LSB- SMD -LRB- CI -RRB- = 1.47 -LRB- 1.06 , 1.88 -RRB- , P < 0.001 -RSB- at 10 months after the intervention concluded . Heterogeneity observed between studies regarding the effect of US on pain was explained by US dose , mode and intensity . The quality of evidence supporting these effect estimates was rated as low . US could be efficacious for decreasing pain and may improve physical function in patients with knee OA . The findings of this review should be confirmed using methodologically rigorous and adequately powered clinical trials . To update the American College of Rheumatology -LRB- ACR -RRB- 2000 recommendations for hip and knee osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- and develop new recommendations for hand OA . A list of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic modalities commonly used to manage knee , hip , and hand OA as well as clinical scenarios representing patients with symptomatic hand , hip , and knee OA were generated . Systematic evidence-based literature reviews were conducted by a working group at the Institute of Population Health , University of Ottawa , and updated by ACR staff to include additions to bibliographic databases through December 31 , 2010 . The Grading of Recommendations Assessment , Development and Evaluation approach , a formal process to rate scientific evidence and to develop recommendations that are as evidence based as possible , was used by a Technical Expert Panel comprised of various stakeholders to formulate the recommendations for the use of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic modalities for OA of the hand , hip , and knee . Both `` strong '' and `` conditional '' recommendations were made for OA management . Modalities conditionally recommended for the management of hand OA include instruction in joint protection techniques , provision of assistive devices , use of thermal modalities and trapeziometacarpal joint splints , and use of oral and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs -LRB- NSAIDs -RRB- , tramadol , and topical capsaicin . Nonpharmacologic modalities strongly recommended for the management of knee OA were aerobic , aquatic , and/or resistance exercises as well as weight loss for overweight patients . Nonpharmacologic modalities conditionally recommended for knee OA included medial wedge insoles for valgus knee OA , subtalar strapped lateral insoles for varus knee OA , medially directed patellar taping , manual therapy , walking aids , thermal agents , tai chi , self management programs , and psychosocial interventions . Pharmacologic modalities conditionally recommended for the initial management of patients with knee OA included acetaminophen , oral and topical NSAIDs , tramadol , and intraarticular corticosteroid injections ; intraarticular hyaluronate injections , duloxetine , and opioids were conditionally recommended in patients who had an inadequate response to initial therapy . Opioid analgesics were strongly recommended in patients who were either not willing to undergo or had contraindications for total joint arthroplasty after having failed medical therapy . Recommendations for hip OA were similar to those for the management of knee OA . These recommendations are based on the consensus judgment of clinical experts from a wide range of disciplines , informed by available evidence , balancing the benefits and harms of both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic modalities , and incorporating their preferences and values . It is hoped that these recommendations will be utilized by health care providers involved in the management of patients with OA . To estimate the lifetime risk of symptomatic hip osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- . We analyzed data from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project -LSB- a longitudinal population-based study of OA in North Carolina , United States -LRB- n = 3068 -RRB- -RSB- . The weighted baseline sample comprised 18 % blacks and 54 % women , and the mean age was 63 years -LRB- range = 45-93 -RRB- . Symptomatic hip OA was defined as a Kellgren-Lawrence -LRB- K-L -RRB- radiographic score of ≥ 2 -LRB- anterior-posterior pelvis X-rays -RRB- and pain , aching or stiffness on most days , or groin pain , in the same hip . Lifetime risk , defined as the proportion who developed symptomatic hip OA in at least one hip by age 85 , among people who live to age 85 , was modeled using logistic regression with repeated measures -LRB- through generalized estimating equations -RRB- . Lifetime risk of symptomatic hip OA was 25.3 % -LSB- 95 % confidence interval -LRB- CI -RRB- = 21.3-29.3 -RSB- . Lifetime risk was similar by sex , race , highest educational attainment , and hip injury history . We studied lifetime risk by body mass index -LRB- BMI -RRB- in three forms : at age 18 ; at baseline and follow-up ; and at age 18 , baseline and follow-up and found no differences in estimates . The burden of symptomatic hip OA is substantial with one in four people developing this condition by age 85 . The similar race-specific estimates suggest that racial disparities in total hip replacements are not attributable to differences in disease occurrence . Despite increasing evidence that obesity predicts an increased risk of both hip OA and joint replacement , we found no association between BMI and lifetime risk . Polyneuropathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus that has been very challenging for clinicians . It results in high public health costs and has a huge impact on patients ' quality of life . Preventive interventions are still the most important approach to avoid plantar ulceration and amputation , which is the most devastating endpoint of the disease . Some therapeutic interventions improve gait quality , confidence , and quality of life ; however , there is no evidence yet of an effective physical therapy treatment for recovering musculoskeletal function and foot rollover during gait that could potentially redistribute plantar pressure and reduce the risk of ulcer formation . A randomised , controlled trial , with blind assessment , was designed to study the effect of a physiotherapy intervention on foot rollover during gait , range of motion , muscle strength and function of the foot and ankle , and balance confidence . The main outcome is plantar pressure during foot rollover , and the secondary outcomes are kinetic and kinematic parameters of gait , neuropathy signs and symptoms , foot and ankle range of motion and function , muscle strength , and balance confidence . The intervention is carried out for 12 weeks , twice a week , for 40-60 min each session . Herein , we present a more comprehensive and specific physiotherapy approach for foot and ankle function , by choosing simple tasks , focusing on recovering range of motion , strength , and functionality of the joints most impaired by diabetic polyneuropathy . In addition , this intervention aims to transfer these peripheral gains to the functional and more complex task of foot rollover during gait , in order to reduce risk of ulceration . If it shows any benefit , this protocol can be used in clinical practice and can be indicated as complementary treatment for this disease . ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01207284 . No detailed exercise programs specifically for patients with hip osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- have been described in the literature . This lack of data creates a gap between the recommendation that people with OA should exercise and the type and dose of exercises that they should perform . The purpose of this case report is to describe and demonstrate the use of a therapeutic exercise program for a patient with hip OA . A 58-year-old woman with hip OA completed a 12-week therapeutic exercise program -LRB- TEP -RRB- with a 6-month follow-up . The patient reported hip pain , joint stiffness , and limited physical function , and she had decreased hip range of motion -LRB- ROM -RRB- at baseline . The patient performed 19 sessions during the TEP , with a mean of 19.5 exercises per session . She increased the resistance in 3 of 5 strength -LRB- force-generating capacity -RRB- training exercises and achieved the highest degree of difficulty in all functional exercises . During the TEP and follow-up , the patient reported improvements in pain , joint stiffness , and physical function . Performance improved on the following physical tests : isokinetic peak torque strength -LRB- 60 degrees / s -RRB- in hip extension -LRB- 40 % -RRB- , hip flexion -LRB- 27 % -RRB- , knee extension -LRB- 17 % -RRB- , and knee flexion -LRB- 42 % -RRB- ; hip ROM extension -LRB- 8 degrees -RRB- ; and 6-minute walk distance -LRB- 83 m -RRB- . The patient experienced less pain and improved physical function and physical test outcomes after intervention and at the 6-month follow-up . The main challenges when prescribing an exercise program for a patient with hip OA are monitoring the exercises to provide improvements without provoking persistent pain and motivating the patient to achieve long-term adherence to exercising . Randomized clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this TEP in patients with hip OA . The primary objective is to identify effective land-based therapeutic exercise interventions and provide evidence-based recommendations for managing hip osteoarthritis . A secondary objective is to develop an Ottawa Panel evidence-based clinical practice guideline for hip osteoarthritis . The search strategy and modified selection criteria from a Cochrane review were used . Studies included hip osteoarthritis patients in comparative controlled trials with therapeutic exercise interventions . An Expert Panel arrived at a Delphi survey consensus to endorse the recommendations . The Ottawa Panel hierarchical alphabetical grading system -LRB- A , B , C + , C , D , D + , or D - -RRB- considered the study design -LRB- level I : randomized controlled trial and level II : controlled clinical trial -RRB- , statistical significance -LRB- p < 0.5 -RRB- , and clinical importance -LRB- ⩾ 15 % improvement -RRB- . Four high-quality studies were included , which demonstrated that variations of strength training , stretching , and flexibility exercises are generally effective for improving the management of hip osteoarthritis . Strength training exercises displayed the greatest improvements for pain -LRB- Grade A -RRB- , disability -LRB- Grades A and C + -RRB- , physical function -LRB- Grade A -RRB- , stiffness -LRB- Grade A -RRB- , and range of motion -LRB- Grade A -RRB- within a short time period -LRB- 8-24 weeks -RRB- . Stretching also greatly improved physical function -LRB- Grade A -RRB- , and flexibility exercises improved pain -LRB- Grade A -RRB- , range of motion -LRB- Grade A -RRB- , physical function -LRB- Grade A -RRB- , and stiffness -LRB- Grade C + -RRB- . The Ottawa Panel recommends land-based therapeutic exercise , notably strength training , for management of hip osteoarthritis in reducing pain , stiffness and self-reported disability , and improving physical function and range of motion . Prolonged physical impairments in range of movement , postural stability and walking speed are commonly reported following total hip replacement -LRB- THR -RRB- . It is unclear from the current body of evidence what kind of exercises should be performed to maximize patient function and quality of life . This will be a single blind multi centre randomized control trial with two arms . Seventy subjects post primary total hip arthroplasty will be randomized into either an experimental group -LRB- n = 35 -RRB- , or to a control group -LRB- n = 35 -RRB- . The experimental group will attend a functional exercise class twice weekly for a six week period from week 12 to week 18 post surgery . The functional exercise group will follow a circuit based functional exercise class supervised by a chartered Physiotherapist . The control group will receive usual care . The principal investigator -LRB- BM -RRB- will perform blinded outcome assessments on all patients using validated measures for pain , stiffness , and function using the Western Ontario and Mc Master Universities Osteoarthritis index -LRB- WOMAC -RRB- . This is the primary outcome measurement tool . Secondary outcome measurements include Quality of life -LRB- SF-36 -RRB- , 6 min walk test , Visual Analogue Scale , and the Berg Balance score . The WOMAC score will be collated on day five post surgery and repeated at week twelve and week eighteen . All other measurements will be taken at week 12 and repeated at week eighteen . In addition a blinded radiologist will measure gluteus medius cross sectional area using real time ultrasound for all subjects at week 12 and at week 18 to determine if the functional exercise programme has any effect on muscle size . This randomised controlled trial will add to the body of evidence on the relationship between muscle size , functional ability , balance , quality of life and time post surgery in patients following total hip arthroplasty . The CONSORT guidelines will be followed to throughout . Ethical approval has been gained from the Ethics committee Health Services Executive Dublin North East . It is unknown whether gait biomechanics in hip osteoarthritis patients with mild to moderate symptoms change following exercise therapy interventions . The aim of the present study was to compare stance phase gait characteristics in hip osteoarthritis patients with mild to moderate symptoms participating in a randomized trial with two different interventions ; patient education only or patient education followed by a 12-week supervised exercise therapy program . The study was conducted as a secondary analysis of a single-blinded randomized controlled trial . Patients aged 40 to 80 years , with hip osteoarthritis verified from self-reported pain and radiographic changes , were included . The final material comprised 23 patients -LRB- 10 males/13 females , mean -LRB- SD -RRB- age 58.2 -LRB- 10.02 -RRB- years -RRB- in the patient education only group , and 22 patients -LRB- 9 males/13 females , mean -LRB- SD -RRB- age 60.2 -LRB- 9.49 -RRB- years -RRB- in the patient education + exercise therapy group . Three-dimensional gait analysis was conducted at baseline and at four month follow-up . Sagittal and frontal plane joint angle displacement and external joint moments of the hip , knee and ankle were compared from a one-way analysis of covariance between the groups at follow-up , with baseline values as covariates -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- . No group differences were observed at the four-month follow-up in gait velocity , joint angle displacement , or moments . As the compliance in the exercise therapy group was inadequate , we calculated possible associations between the number of completed exercise sessions and change in each of the kinematic or kinetic variables . Associations were weak to neglible . Thus , the negative findings in this study can not be explained from inadequate compliance alone , but most likely also suggest the exercise therapy program itself to be insufficient to engender gait alterations . Adding a 12-week supervised exercise therapy program to patient education did not induce changes in our selected biomechanical variables during the stance phase of gait , even when adjusting for poor compliance . Thus , we did not find evidence to support our exercise therapy program to be an efficacious intervention to induce gait alterations in this population of hip osteoarthritis patients . NCT00319423 at ClinicalTrials.gov -LRB- registration date 2006-04-26 -RRB- . To evaluate the efficacy of an in-hospital programme based on task-oriented exercises associated with early full weight-bearing in patients with multiple comorbidities undergoing total hip replacement . Randomized controlled trial . Specialised rehabilitation centre . A total of 100 patients -LRB- mean age of 69 -LRB- 8 -RRB- years ; 40 males , 60 females -RRB- . The experimental group underwent task-oriented exercises and was encouraged to abandon any walking aids by the end of their in-hospital stay . The control group underwent open chain kinetic exercises , and was recommended to use partial weight-bearing and walking aids until three months after surgery . Both groups individually followed programmes of 90-minute sessions five times a week for three weeks . Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index , Pain Numerical Rating Scale , Functional Independence Measure , and Short-Form Health Survey . The participants were evaluated before , after training , and after a further 12 months . There were no significant between-group differences at baseline . After training , a between-group difference of 12 points was found for the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index - functional subscale , indicating a clinically tangible treatment effect on disability . The Functional Independence Measure increased by 31 and 15 points in the experimental and control group , respectively . A linear mixed model revealed significant effects of time , group , and time by group interaction on disability , pain , activities of daily living , and most of the physical quality of life domains . Task-oriented exercises associated with early full weight-bearing improve disability , pain , activities of daily living , and quality of life after total hip replacement . To investigate the feasibility and the effects on gait of a high intensity task-oriented training , incorporating a high cardiovascular workload and large number of repetitions , in patients with subacute stroke , when compared to a low intensity physiotherapy-programme . Randomized controlled clinical trial : Forty-four patients with stroke were recruited at 2 to 8 weeks after stroke onset . Maximal gait speed assessed with the 10-metre timed walking test -LRB- 10MTWT -RRB- , walking capacity assessed with the six-minute walk test -LRB- 6MWT -RRB- . Control of standing balance assessed with the Berg Balance Scale and the Functional Reach test . Group differences were analysed using a Mann-Whitney U-test . Between-group analysis showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the high intensity task-oriented training in performance on the 10MTWT -LRB- Z = -2.13 , P = 0.03 -RRB- and the 6MWT -LRB- Z = -2.26 , P = 0.02 -RRB- . No between-group difference were found for the Berg Balance Scale -LRB- Z = -0.07 , P = 0.45 -RRB- and the Functional Reach test -LRB- Z = -0.21 , P = 0.84 -RRB- . A high-intensity task-oriented training programme designed to improve hemiplegic gait and physical fitness was feasible in the present study and the effectiveness exceeds a low intensity physiotherapy-programme in terms of gait speed and walking capacity in patients with subacute stroke . In a future study , it seems appropriate to additionally use measures to evaluate physical fitness and energy expenditure while walking . The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety , feasibility and preliminary effects of a high-intensity rehabilitative task-oriented circuit training -LRB- TOCT -RRB- in a sample of multiple sclerosis -LRB- MS -RRB- subjects on walking competency , mobility , fatigue and health-related quality of life -LRB- HRQoL -RRB- . 24 MS subjects -LRB- EDSS 4.89 ± 0.54 , 17 female and 7 male , 52.58 ± 11.21 years , MS duration 15.21 ± 8.68 years -RRB- have been enrolled and randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups : -LRB- i -RRB- experimental group received 10 TOCT sessions over 2 weeks -LRB- 2 hours/each session -RRB- followed by a 3 months home exercise program , whereas control group did not receive any specific rehabilitation intervention . A feasibility patient-reported questionnaire was administered after TOCT . Functional outcome measures were : walking endurance -LRB- Six Minute Walk Test -RRB- , gait speed -LRB- 10 Meter Walk Test -RRB- , mobility -LRB- Timed Up and Go test -RRB- and balance -LRB- Dynamic Gait Index -RRB- . Furthermore , self-reported questionnaire of motor fatigue -LRB- Fatigue Severity Scale -RRB- , walking ability -LRB- Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale - 12 -RRB- and health-related quality of life -LRB- Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale - 29 -RRB- were included . Subjects ' assessments were delivered at baseline -LRB- T0 -RRB- , after TOCT -LRB- T1 -RRB- and 3 months of home-based exercise program -LRB- T2 -RRB- . After TOCT subjects reported a positive global rating on the received treatment . At 3 months , we found a 58.33 % of adherence to the home-exercise program . After TOCT , walking ability and health-related quality of life were improved -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- with minor retention after 3 months . The control group showed no significant changes in any variables . This two weeks high-intensity task-oriented circuit class training followed by a three months home-based exercise program seems feasible and safe in MS people with moderate mobility impairments ; moreover it might improve walking abilities . NCT01464749 . To determine whether a functional-task exercise program and a resistance exercise program have different effects on the ability of community-living older people to perform daily tasks . A randomized , controlled , single-blind trial . Community leisure center in Utrecht , the Netherlands . Ninety-eight healthy women aged 70 and older were randomly assigned to the functional-task exercise program -LRB- function group , n = 33 -RRB- , a resistance exercise program -LRB- resistance group , n = 34 -RRB- , or a control group -LRB- n = 31 -RRB- . Participants attended exercise classes three times a week for 12 weeks . Functional task performance -LRB- Assessment of Daily Activity Performance -LRB- ADAP -RRB- -RRB- , isometric knee extensor strength -LRB- IKES -RRB- , handgrip strength , isometric elbow flexor strength -LRB- IEFS -RRB- , and leg extension power were measured at baseline , at the end of training -LRB- at 3 months -RRB- , and 6 months after the end of training -LRB- at 9 months -RRB- . The ADAP total score of the function group -LRB- mean change 6.8 , 95 % confidence interval -LRB- CI -RRB- = 5.2-8.4 -RRB- increased significantly more than that of the resistance group -LRB- 3.2 , 95 % CI = 1.3-5.0 ; P = .007 -RRB- or the control group -LRB- 0.3 , 95 % CI = -1.3-1.9 ; P < .001 -RRB- . Moreover , the ADAP total score of the resistance group did not change significantly compared with that of the control group . In contrast , IKES and IEFS increased significantly in the resistance group -LRB- 12.5 % , 95 % CI = 3.8-21.3 and 8.6 % , 95 % CI = 3.1-14.1 , respectively -RRB- compared with the function group -LRB- -2.1 % , 95 % CI = -5.4-1.3 ; P = .003 and 0.3 % , 95 % CI = -3.6-4.2 ; P = .03 , respectively -RRB- and the control group -LRB- -2.7 % , 95 % CI = -8.6-3.2 , P = .003 and 0.6 % , 95 % CI = -3.4-4.6 ; P = .04 , respectively -RRB- . Six months after the end of training , the increase in ADAP scores was sustained in the function group -LRB- P = .002 -RRB- . Functional-task exercises are more effective than resistance exercises at improving functional task performance in healthy elderly women and may have an important role in helping them maintain an independent lifestyle . To determine the effectiveness of a manual therapy program compared with an exercise therapy program in patients with osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- of the hip . A single-blind , randomized clinical trial of 109 hip OA patients was carried out in the outpatient clinic for physical therapy of a large hospital . The manual therapy program focused on specific manipulations and mobilization of the hip joint . The exercise therapy program focused on active exercises to improve muscle function and joint motion . The treatment period was 5 weeks -LRB- 9 sessions -RRB- . The primary outcome was general perceived improvement after treatment . Secondary outcomes included pain , hip function , walking speed , range of motion , and quality of life . Of 109 patients included in the study , 56 were allocated to manual therapy and 53 to exercise therapy . No major differences were found on baseline characteristics between groups . Success rates -LRB- primary outcome -RRB- after 5 weeks were 81 % in the manual therapy group and 50 % in the exercise group -LRB- odds ratio 1.92 , 95 % confidence interval 1.30 , 2.60 -RRB- . Furthermore , patients in the manual therapy group had significantly better outcomes on pain , stiffness , hip function , and range of motion . Effects of manual therapy on the improvement of pain , hip function , and range of motion endured after 29 weeks . The effect of the manual therapy program on hip function is superior to the exercise therapy program in patients with OA of the hip . Roughly one in ten persons in the industrialized world suffers from hip osteoarthritis , a disease for which there is no cure . The goal of conservative therapy is to relieve symptoms , preferably with methods that let patients assume responsibility for their own treatment , e.g. , physical training . In a randomized controlled trial , we studied the effectiveness of twelve weeks of exercise therapy in patients with hip osteoarthritis -LRB- THüKo -RRB- , compared to no treatment -LRB- control group -RRB- and placebo ultrasound treatment of the hip -LRB- placebo ultrasound group -RRB- . The primary endpoint was a comparison of the pain scores of the intervention versus control groups on the generic SF-36 health questionnaire . Secondary endpoints included comparisons across all three study groups of scores on the 7 other scales of the SF-36 and on the pain , physical function , and stiffness scales of the osteoarthritis-specific WOMAC Index . The statistical analysis was performed with ANCOVA , with baseline values as a covariate . Between-group effects were subsequently tested pairwise -LRB- two-tailed t-tests , alpha = 0.05 -RRB- . As for the primary endpoint , pain reduction was significantly greater in the intervention than in the control group -LRB- mean difference 5.7 points , 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- 0.4-11.1 points , p = 0.034 -RRB- . The comparisons across all three study groups -LRB- i.e. , secondary endpoints , with 71 subjects in the intervention group , 68 in the control group , and 70 in the placebo group -RRB- revealed no significant between-group effects with respect to the SF-36 . On the WOMAC Index , however , statistically significant differences were found for pain reduction between the intervention and control group -LRB- mean difference 7.4 points , 95 % CI 3.0-11.8 , p = 0.001 -RRB- and between the intervention and placebo group -LRB- mean difference 5.1 points , 95 % CI 0.7-9.4 , p = 0.024 -RRB- . Comparable mean differences were also found for functional improvement . Twelve weeks of exercise therapy in hip osteoarthritis patients of normal vitality reduced pain and improved physical function . No significant improvement was found in these patients ' general health-related quality of life . To the best of our knowledge , there is no study in the English literature about the usefulness of ultrasound therapy in degenerative hip osteoarthritis . The aim of this study was to examine its short - and long-term efficacy in patients with primary hip osteoarthritis with regard to pain , functional status , and quality of life -LRB- QoL -RRB- . Forty-five patients with primary hip osteoarthritis were enrolled into the study . Demographic and clinical characteristics including age , sex , duration of disease , and pain on activity and at rest using visual analogue scale -LRB- VAS -RRB- were recorded . Functional status was determined by a 15-m timed walking test and Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Questionnaire . QoL was determined by the Short Form-36 survey -LRB- SF-36 -RRB- . Each patient was randomly assigned to either group I -LRB- standard physical therapy including hot pack and exercise program -RRB- , group II -LRB- sham ultrasound in addition to standard physical therapy -RRB- , or group III -LRB- ultrasound and standard physical therapy -RRB- . The main outcome measures of the treatment were pain intensity by VAS ; functional status measurements that were evaluated at baseline , at the end of the therapies , and at the first and third month of follow-up ; and QoL scores that were determined at baseline and at the end of the first and third months . Twelve male and 33 female patients -LRB- mean age , 65.3 ± 6.7 years ; mean disease duration , 2.5 ± 1.7 years -RRB- were included in the study . There were no differences between the groups regarding demographic variables on entry to the study . There were 15 patients in each group . Pain and functional outcome measures were determined to have improved significantly in all of the groups at the end of the therapies , but these improvements continued at the end of the first and third months only in group III -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- The physical subscores of SF-36 were improved at the end of the first month and were maintained at the end of the third month only in patients receiving additional ultrasound therapy -LRB- group III , p < 0.001 -RRB- , while mental subscores of SF-36 did not change significantly in any group . In conclusion , addition of therapeutic ultrasound to the traditional physical therapy showed a longitudinal positive effect on pain , functional status , and physical QoL in patients with hip osteoarthritis . The use of therapeutic ultrasound in the treatment of hip osteoarthritis should be encouraged , and it seems worthy to continue with large clinical trials on ultrasound in order to standardize the treatment modality in this patient group . The goal of this study was to determine if increasing strength in primary knee extensors and flexors would directly affect net knee joint moments during a common functional task in persons with knee osteoarthritis . An exploratory single sample clinical trial with pre-post treatment measures was used to study volunteers with clinical diagnosis of mild knee osteoarthritis -LRB- OA -RRB- in one knee . Subjects participated in an individually supervised training program 3 times a week for eight weeks consisting of progressive resistive exercises for knee extensors and knee flexors . Pre and post training outcome assessments included : 1 . Net internal knee joint moments , 2 . Electromyography of primary knee extensors and flexors , and 3 . Self-report measures of knee pain and function . The distribution of lower extremity joint moments as a percent of the total support moment was also investigated . Pain , symptoms , activities of daily life , quality of life , stiffness , and function scores showed significant improvement following strength training . Knee internal valgus and hip internal rotation moments showed increasing but non-statistically significant changes post-training . There were no significant differences in muscle co-contraction activation of the Quadriceps and Hamstrings . While exercise continues to be an important element of OA management , the results of this study suggest improvements in function , pain , and other symptoms , as a result of strength training may not be causally related to specific biomechanical changes in net joint moments .	At the end of the treatment , the mean temperature increase was significantly different only during the first 5-minute interval post-treatment . There was a significant difference in the rate of collagen fibers -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- . The rate of temperature increased per 2 subjects -LRB- P = .001 -RRB- . In the past 25 years , there have been no in vivo studies that have measured rate of change in temperature during 1-MHz ultrasound treatments , and none have ever been performed with the 3-MHz frequency of recording the tendon temperature every 30 seconds during , and for 20 minutes after , the 4-minute treatment confirm that the rate and magnitude of temperature change per ERA + / - 1.2 degrees C -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- , we had eight subjects each undergo either the 2-or treatment size -LRB- range , and 2.0 % , and temperature was measured every 30 degrees C , depending on the desired treatment of temperature W/cm -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- . There was no effect on treatment area , intensity , and duration can have a large effect on temperature change . The rate of

This trial is a substudy of the NONSEDA trial where critically ill patients are randomized to non-sedation or to sedation with a daily wake-up attempt during mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit -LRB- ICU -RRB- . The aim of this substudy is to assess the effects of non-sedation versus sedation with a daily wake-up attempt on long-term cognitive function . This is an investigator-initiated , randomized , clinical , parallel-group , superiority trial , including 200 patients . Inclusion criteria will be adult patients who are intubated and on mechanical ventilation with an expected duration of more than 24 hours . Exclusion criteria will be patients who are comatose at admission and patients with conditions requiring therapeutic coma -LRB- i.e. , severe head trauma , status epilepticus , patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia and patients with severe hypoxia -RRB- . The experimental intervention will be non-sedation supplemented with pain management during mechanical ventilation . The control intervention will be sedation with a daily wake-up attempt . The primary outcome will be cognitive function 3 months after discharge from intensive care . If non-sedation can improve long-term cognitive function , it could be an approach worth considering for a larger group of critically ill patients . The study has been approved by the relevant scientific ethics committee and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov -LRB- ID : NCT02035436 , registered on 10 January 2014 -RRB- . Through many years , the standard care has been to use continuous sedation of critically ill patients during mechanical ventilation . However , preliminary randomised clinical trials indicate that it is beneficial to reduce the sedation level . No randomised trial has been conducted comparing sedation with no sedation , a priori powered to have all-cause mortality as primary outcome.The objective is to assess the benefits and harms of non-sedation versus sedation with a daily wake-up trial in critically ill patients . The non-sedation -LRB- NONSEDA -RRB- trial is an investigator-initiated , randomised , clinical , parallel-group , multinational trial designed to include 700 patients from at least six ICUs in Denmark , Norway and Sweden.Inclusion criteria are mechanically ventilated patients with expected duration of mechanical ventilation > 24 hours.Exclusion criteria are non-intubated patients , patients with severe head trauma , coma at admission or status epilepticus , patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia , patients with PaO2/FiO2 < 9 where sedation might be necessary to ensure sufficient oxygenation or place the patient in prone position.Experimental intervention is non-sedation supplemented with pain management during mechanical ventilation.Control intervention is sedation with a daily wake-up trial.The primary outcome will be all cause mortality at 90 days after randomization . Secondary outcomes will be : days until death throughout the total observation period ; coma - and delirium-free days ; highest RIFLE score ; days until discharge from the intensive care unit -LRB- within 28 days -RRB- ; days until the participant is without mechanical ventilation -LRB- within 28 days -RRB- ; and proportion of patients with a major cardiovascular outcome . Explorative outcomes will be : all cause mortality at 28 days after randomisation ; days until discharge from the intensive care unit ; days until the participant is without mechanical ventilation ; days until discharge from the hospital ; organ failure.Trial size : we will include 700 participants -LRB- 2 × 350 -RRB- in order to detect or reject 25 % relative risk reduction in mortality with a type I error risk of 5 % and a type II error risk of 20 % -LRB- power at 80 % -RRB- . The trial investigates potential benefits of non-sedation . This might have large impact on the future treatment of mechanically ventilated critically ill patients . ClinicalTrials.gov NCT0196768 , 09.01.2014 . Delirium is a postoperative complication that occurs frequently in patients older than 65 years , and presages adverse outcomes . We investigated whether prophylactic low-dose dexmedetomidine , a highly selective α <sub> 2 </sub> adrenoceptor agonist , could safely decrease the incidence of delirium in elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery . We did this randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial in two tertiary-care hospitals in Beijing , China . We enrolled patients aged 65 years or older , who were admitted to intensive care units after non-cardiac surgery , with informed consent . We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence -LRB- in a 1:1 ratio -RRB- to randomly assign patients to receive either intravenous dexmedetomidine -LRB- 0 · 1 μg/kg per h , from intensive care unit admission on the day of surgery until 0800 h on postoperative day 1 -RRB- , or placebo -LRB- intravenous normal saline -RRB- . Participants , care providers , and investigators were all masked to group assignment . The primary endpoint was the incidence of delirium , assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method for intensive care units during the first 7 postoperative days . Analyses were done by intention-to-treat and safety populations . This study is registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry , www.chictr.org.cn , number ChiCTR-TRC-10000802 . Between Aug 17 , 2011 , and Nov 20 , 2013 , of 2016 patients assessed , 700 were randomly assigned to receive either placebo -LRB- n = 350 -RRB- or dexmedetomidine -LRB- n = 350 -RRB- . The incidence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group -LRB- 32 -LSB- 9 % -RSB- of 350 patients -RRB- than in the placebo group -LRB- 79 -LSB- 23 % -RSB- of 350 patients ; odds ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- 0 · 35 , 95 % CI 0 · 22-0 · 54 ; p < 0 · 0001 -RRB- . Regarding safety , the incidence of hypertension was higher with placebo -LRB- 62 -LSB- 18 % -RSB- of 350 patients -RRB- than with dexmedetomidine -LRB- 34 -LSB- 10 % -RSB- of 350 patients ; 0 · 50 , 0 · 32-0 · 78 ; p = 0 · 002 -RRB- . Tachycardia was also higher in patients given placebo -LRB- 48 -LSB- 14 % -RSB- of 350 patients -RRB- than in patients given dexmedetomidine -LRB- 23 -LSB- 7 % -RSB- of 350 patients ; 0 · 44 , 0 · 26-0 · 75 ; p = 0 · 002 -RRB- . Occurrence of hypotension and bradycardia did not differ between groups . For patients aged over 65 years who are admitted to the intensive care unit after non-cardiac surgery , prophylactic low-dose dexmedetomidine significantly decreases the occurrence of delirium during the first 7 days after surgery . The therapy is safe . Braun Anaesthesia Scientific Research Fund and Wu Jieping Medical Foundation , Beijing , China . Study drugs were manufactured and supplied by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co , Ltd , Jiangsu , China . This meta-analysis was performed to assess the influence of dexmedetomidine and propofol for adult intensive care unit -LRB- ICU -RRB- sedation , with respect to patient outcomes and adverse events . A systematic review was conducted of all randomized controlled trials exploring the clinical benefits of dexmedetomidine versus propofol for sedation in adult intensive care patients . The primary outcomes of this study were length of ICU stay , duration of mechanical ventilation , and risk of ICU mortality . Secondary outcomes included risk of delirium , hypotension , bradycardia and hypertension . Ten randomized controlled trials , involving 1202 patients , were included . Dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the length of ICU stay by < 1 d -LRB- five studies , 655 patients ; mean difference , -0.81 d ; 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , -1.48 to -0.15 -RRB- and the incidence of delirium -LRB- three studies , 658 patients ; relative risk -LSB- RR -RSB- , 0.40 ; 95 % CI , 0.22-0.74 -RRB- in comparison with propofol , whereas there was no difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation -LRB- five studies , 895 patients ; mean difference , 0.53 h ; 95 % CI -2.66 to 3.72 -RRB- or ICU mortality -LRB- five studies , 267 patients ; RR , 0.83 ; 95 % CI , 0.32-2.12 -RRB- between these two drugs . Dexmedetomidine was associated with an increased risk of hypertension -LRB- three studies , 846 patients ; RR , 1.56 ; 95 % CI , 1.11-2.20 -RRB- compared with propofol . Other adverse event rates were similar between dexmedetomidine and propofol groups . For ICU patient sedation , dexmedetomidine may offer advantages over propofol in terms of decrease in the length of ICU stay and the risk of delirium . However , transient hypertension may occur when dexmedetomidine is administered with a loading dose or at high infusion rates . Dexmedetomidine is a novel sedative agent that causes anxiolysis without respiratory depression in critically ill patients . We sought to examine patient and hospital variation in dexmedetomidine use and adoption patterns of dexmedetomidine over time . We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients who received intravenous infusion sedation in 174 intensive care units contributing data to Project IMPACT from 2001 through 2007 . Sedation use was defined as having received an intravenous sedative infusion -LRB- dexmedetomidine , midazolam , lorazepam , or propofol -RRB- for any period during the intensive care stay . The primary outcome was use of dexmedetomidine in the intensive care unit . Of 58,391 patients who received intravenous infusion sedation , 2,535 -LRB- 4.3 % , 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , 4.2-4.5 -RRB- received dexmedetomidine . Overall use was highest in cardiac surgery patients -LRB- 11.7 % , 10.8-12.7 -RRB- and was similar in other surgical patients -LRB- 4.3 % , 4.0-4.6 -RRB- and medical patients -LRB- 3.4 % , 3.2-3.6 , P < 0.001 -RRB- . Use of dexmedetomidine increased from 2.0 % -LRB- 1.6-2.4 -RRB- of patients receiving intravenous infusion sedation in 2001 to 7.2 % -LRB- 6.6-7.9 -RRB- in 2007 -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , primarily because of an increase in use in cardiac surgery patients -LRB- 1.4 % , 0.0-2.8 , in 2001 vs. 20.2 % , 17.6-22.8 in 2007 , P < 0.001 -RRB- . Of the patients who received dexmedetomidine , 31.5 % -LRB- 29.6-33.3 -RRB- received the infusion for more than 1 day , and 10.9 % were not mechanically ventilated . Use of dexmedetomidine in critically ill patients has increased over time , primarily as a result of an increase in use among cardiac surgery patients . A substantial portion of dexmedetomidine was administered outside of the regulatory approval guidelines at the time . Long-term sedation with midazolam or propofol in intensive care units -LRB- ICUs -RRB- has serious adverse effects . Dexmedetomidine , an α -LRB- 2 -RRB- - agonist available for ICU sedation , may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and enhance patient comfort . To determine the efficacy of dexmedetomidine vs midazolam or propofol -LRB- preferred usual care -RRB- in maintaining sedation ; reducing duration of mechanical ventilation ; and improving patients ' interaction with nursing care . Two phase 3 multicenter , randomized , double-blind trials carried out from 2007 to 2010 . The MIDEX trial compared midazolam with dexmedetomidine in ICUs of 44 centers in 9 European countries ; the PRODEX trial compared propofol with dexmedetomidine in 31 centers in 6 European countries and 2 centers in Russia . Included were adult ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation who needed light to moderate sedation for more than 24 hours -LRB- midazolam , n = 251 , vs dexmedetomidine , n = 249 ; propofol , n = 247 , vs dexmedetomidine , n = 251 -RRB- . Sedation with dexmedetomidine , midazolam , or propofol ; daily sedation stops ; and spontaneous breathing trials . For each trial , we tested whether dexmedetomidine was noninferior to control with respect to proportion of time at target sedation level -LRB- measured by Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale -RRB- and superior to control with respect to duration of mechanical ventilation . Secondary end points were patients ' ability to communicate pain -LRB- measured using a visual analogue scale -LSB- VAS -RSB- -RRB- and length of ICU stay . Time at target sedation was analyzed in per-protocol population -LRB- midazolam , n = 233 , vs dexmedetomidine , n = 227 ; propofol , n = 214 , vs dexmedetomidine , n = 223 -RRB- . Dexmedetomidine/midazolam ratio in time at target sedation was 1.07 -LRB- 95 % CI , 0.97-1.18 -RRB- and dexmedetomidine/propofol , 1.00 -LRB- 95 % CI , 0.92-1.08 -RRB- . Median duration of mechanical ventilation appeared shorter with dexmedetomidine -LRB- 123 hours -LSB- IQR , 67-337 -RSB- -RRB- vs midazolam -LRB- 164 hours -LSB- IQR , 92-380 -RSB- ; P = .03 -RRB- but not with dexmedetomidine -LRB- 97 hours -LSB- IQR , 45-257 -RSB- -RRB- vs propofol -LRB- 118 hours -LSB- IQR , 48-327 -RSB- ; P = .24 -RRB- . Patients ' interaction -LRB- measured using VAS -RRB- was improved with dexmedetomidine -LRB- estimated score difference vs midazolam , 19.7 -LSB- 95 % CI , 15.2-24.2 -RSB- ; P < .001 ; and vs propofol , 11.2 -LSB- 95 % CI , 6.4-15.9 -RSB- ; P < .001 -RRB- . Length of ICU and hospital stay and mortality were similar . Dexmedetomidine vs midazolam patients had more hypotension -LRB- 51/247 -LSB- 20.6 % -RSB- vs 29/250 -LSB- 11.6 % -RSB- ; P = .007 -RRB- and bradycardia -LRB- 35/247 -LSB- 14.2 % -RSB- vs 13/250 -LSB- 5.2 % -RSB- ; P < .001 -RRB- . Among ICU patients receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation , dexmedetomidine was not inferior to midazolam and propofol in maintaining light to moderate sedation . Dexmedetomidine reduced duration of mechanical ventilation compared with midazolam and improved patients ' ability to communicate pain compared with midazolam and propofol . More adverse effects were associated with dexmedetomidine . clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers : NCT00481312 , NCT00479661 . Delirium is a frequent occurrence in older intensive care unit -LRB- ICU -RRB- patients , but the importance of the duration of delirium in contributing to adverse long-term outcomes is unclear . To examine the association of the number of days of ICU delirium with mortality in an older patient population . We performed a prospective cohort study in a 14-bed ICU in an urban acute care hospital . The patient population comprised 304 consecutive admissions 60 years of age and older . The main outcome was 1-year mortality after ICU admission . Patients were assessed daily for delirium with the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and a validated chart review method . The median duration of ICU delirium was 3 days -LRB- range , 1-46 d -RRB- . During the follow-up period , 153 -LRB- 50 % -RRB- patients died . After adjusting for relevant covariates , including age , severity of illness , comorbid conditions , psychoactive medication use , and baseline cognitive and functional status , the number of days of ICU delirium was significantly associated with time to death within 1 year post-ICU admission -LRB- hazard ratio , 1.10 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.02-1.18 -RRB- . Number of days of ICU delirium was associated with higher 1-year mortality after adjustment for relevant covariates in an older ICU population . Investigations should be undertaken to reduce the number of days of ICU delirium and to study the impact of this reduction on important health outcomes , including mortality and functional and cognitive status . This research studied the long term outcome of intensive care delirium defined as mortality and quality of life at three and six months after discharge of the intensive care unit . Delirium in the intensive care unit is known to result in worse outcomes . Cognitive impairment , a longer stay in the hospital or in the intensive care unit and a raised mortality have been reported . A prospective cohort study . A population of 105 consecutive patients was included during the stay at the intensive care unit in July-August 2006 . The population was assessed once a day for delirium using the NEECHAM Confusion Scale and the CAM-ICU . Patients were visited at home by a nurse researcher to assess the quality of life using the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form General Health Survey at three and six months after discharge of the intensive care unit . Delirious and non delirious patients were compared for mortality and quality of life . Compared to the non delirious patients , more delirious patients died . The total study population discharged from the intensive care unit , scored lower for quality of life in all domains compared to the reference population . The domains showed lower results for the delirious patients compared to the non delirious patients . Mortality was higher in delirious patients . All patients showed lower values for the quality of life at three months . The delirious patients showed lower results than the non delirious patients . Nurses are the first caregivers to observe patients . The fluctuating delirious process is often not noticed . Long term effects are not visible to the interdisciplinary team in the hospital . This paper would like to raise the awareness of professionals for long term outcomes for patients having experienced delirium in the intensive care unit . Delirium is an acute disturbance of consciousness and cognition that has been shown to be associated with poor outcomes , including increased mortality . We aimed to evaluate outcome after postoperative delirium in a cohort of surgical intensive care unit -LRB- SICU -RRB- patients . This prospective study was conducted over a 10-month period in a SICU . Postoperative delirium was diagnosed in accordance with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist -LRB- ICDSC -RRB- . The primary outcome was mortality at 6-month follow-up . Hospital mortality and becoming dependent were considered as secondary outcomes , on the basis of the evaluation of the patient 's ability to undertake both personal and instrumental activities of daily living -LRB- ADL -RRB- before surgery and 6 months after discharge from the SICU . For each dichotomous outcome - hospital mortality , mortality at 6-month follow-up , and becoming dependent - a separate multiple logistic regression analysis was performed , which included delirium as an independent variable . Another outcome analyzed was changes in health-related quality of life , as determined using short-form 36 -LRB- SF-36 -RRB- , which was administered before and 6 months after discharge from the SICU . Additionally , for each SF-36 domain , a separate multiple linear regression model was used for each SF-36 domain , with changes in the SF-36 domain as a dependent variable and delirium as an independent variable . Of 775 SICU-admitted adults , 562 were enrolled in the study , of which 89 -LRB- 16 % -RRB- experienced postoperative delirium . Delirium was an independent risk factor for mortality at the 6-month follow-up -LRB- OR = 2.562 , P < 0.001 -RRB- and also for hospital mortality -LRB- OR = 2.673 , P < 0.001 -RRB- . Delirium was also an independent risk factor for becoming dependent for personal ADL -LRB- P-ADL -RRB- after SICU discharge -LRB- OR = 2.188 , P < 0.046 -RRB- . Moreover , patients who experienced postoperative delirium showed a greater decline in SF-36 domains after discharge , particularly in physical function , vitality , and social function , as compared to patients without postoperative delirium . Postoperative delirium was an independent risk factor for 6-month follow-up mortality , hospital mortality , and becoming independent in P-ADL after SICU discharge . It was also significantly associated with a worsening in the quality of life after surgery . In the intensive care unit -LRB- ICU -RRB- , delirium is a common yet underdiagnosed form of organ dysfunction , and its contribution to patient outcomes is unclear . To determine if delirium is an independent predictor of clinical outcomes , including 6-month mortality and length of stay among ICU patients receiving mechanical ventilation . Prospective cohort study enrolling 275 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients admitted to adult medical and coronary ICUs of a US university-based medical center between February 2000 and May 2001 . Patients were followed up for development of delirium over 2158 ICU days using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale . Primary outcomes included 6-month mortality , overall hospital length of stay , and length of stay in the post-ICU period . Secondary outcomes were ventilator-free days and cognitive impairment at hospital discharge . Of 275 patients , 51 -LRB- 18.5 % -RRB- had persistent coma and died in the hospital . Among the remaining 224 patients , 183 -LRB- 81.7 % -RRB- developed delirium at some point during the ICU stay . Baseline demographics including age , comorbidity scores , dementia scores , activities of daily living , severity of illness , and admission diagnoses were similar between those with and without delirium -LRB- P > .05 for all -RRB- . Patients who developed delirium had higher 6-month mortality rates -LRB- 34 % vs 15 % , P = .03 -RRB- and spent 10 days longer in the hospital than those who never developed delirium -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- . After adjusting for covariates -LRB- including age , severity of illness , comorbid conditions , coma , and use of sedatives or analgesic medications -RRB- , delirium was independently associated with higher 6-month mortality -LRB- adjusted hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- , 3.2 ; 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , 1.4-7.7 ; P = .008 -RRB- , and longer hospital stay -LRB- adjusted HR , 2.0 ; 95 % CI , 1.4-3.0 ; P < .001 -RRB- . Delirium in the ICU was also independently associated with a longer post-ICU stay -LRB- adjusted HR , 1.6 ; 95 % CI , 1.2-2.3 ; P = .009 -RRB- , fewer median days alive and without mechanical ventilation -LRB- 19 -LSB- interquartile range , 4-23 -RSB- vs 24 -LSB- 19-26 -RSB- ; adjusted P = .03 -RRB- , and a higher incidence of cognitive impairment at hospital discharge -LRB- adjusted HR , 9.1 ; 95 % CI , 2.3-35.3 ; P = .002 -RRB- . Delirium was an independent predictor of higher 6-month mortality and longer hospital stay even after adjusting for relevant covariates including coma , sedatives , and analgesics in patients receiving mechanical ventilation . : This study evaluated the incidence of postoperative delirium -LRB- POD -RRB- in elderly patients undergoing general surgery , the risk factors associated with POD , and its impact on hospital stay and mortality . : Patients aged over 65 years who had emergency or elective operations were eligible for this case-control study . Risk factors significantly associated with POD using univariable analysis were entered into multivariable analysis , to establish those independently associated with POD . : A total of 351 patients -LRB- 357 admissions -RRB- were enrolled in the study . The incidence of POD was 13.2 per cent -LRB- 17.9 per cent for emergency operations -RRB- . Independent variables associated with POD were : age above 75 years , co-morbidity , preoperative cognitive impairment , psychopathological symptoms and abnormal glycaemic control . Median length of hospital stay was 21 -LRB- range 1-75 -RRB- days for patients with POD versus 8 -LRB- range 1-79 -RRB- days for control patients -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- . The hospital mortality rate was 19 and 8.4 per cent respectively -LRB- P = 0.021 -RRB- . : The incidence of POD is high in elderly patients for both emergency and elective surgery , leading to an increase in hospital stay and perioperative mortality . To minimize POD , associated risk factors of co-morbidity , cognitive impairment , psychopathology and abnormal glycaemic control must be identified and treated . To determine the relationship between delirium in the intensive care unit -LRB- ICU -RRB- and outcomes including length of stay in the hospital . A prospective cohort study . The adult medical ICU of a tertiary care , university-based medical center . The study population consisted of 48 patients admitted to the ICU , 24 of whom received mechanical ventilation . All patients were evaluated for the development and persistence of delirium on a daily basis by a geriatric or psychiatric specialist with expertise in delirium assessment using the Diagnostic Statistical Manual IV -LRB- DSM-IV -RRB- criteria of the American Psychiatric Association , the reference standard for delirium ratings . Primary outcomes measured were length of stay in the ICU and hospital . The mean onset of delirium was 2.6 days -LRB- S.D. + / -1.7 -RRB- , and the mean duration was 3.4 + / -1.9 days . Of the 48 patients , 39 -LRB- 81.3 % -RRB- developed delirium , and of these 29 -LRB- 60.4 % -RRB- developed the complication while still in the ICU . Using multivariate analysis , delirium was the strongest predictor of length of stay in the hospital -LRB- P = 0.006 -RRB- even after adjusting for severity of illness , age , gender , race , and days of benzodiazepine and narcotic drug administration . In this patient cohort , the majority of patients developed delirium in the ICU , and delirium was the strongest independent determinant of length of stay in the hospital . Further study and monitoring of delirium in the ICU and the risk factors for its development are warranted . We previously noted that older adults admitted to surgical ICUs -LRB- SICUs -RRB- are at high risk for delirium . In the current study , we describe the association between the presence of delirium and complications in older SICU patients , and describe the association between delirium occurring in the SICU and functional ability and discharge placement for older patients . Secondary analysis of prospective , observational , cohort study . Subjects were 114 consecutive patients > or = 65 years old admitted to a surgical critical care service . All subjects underwent daily delirium and sedation/agitation screening during hospitalization . Outcomes prospectively recorded included SICU complication development , discharge location , and functional ability -LRB- as measured by the Katz activities of daily living instrument -RRB- . Nearly one third of older adults -LRB- 31.6 % -RRB- admitted to an SICU had a complication during ICU stay . There was a strong association between SICU delirium and complication occurrence -LRB- p = 0.001 -RRB- . Complication occurrence preceded delirium diagnosis for 16 of 20 subjects . Subjects with delirium in the SICU were more likely to be discharged to a place other than home -LRB- 61.3 % vs 20.5 % , p < 0.0001 -RRB- and have greater functional decline -LRB- 67.7 % vs 43.6 % , p = 0.023 -RRB- than nondelirious subjects . After adjusting for covariates including severity of illness and mechanical ventilation use , delirium was found to be strongly and independently associated with greater odds of being discharged to a place other than home -LRB- odds ratio , 7.20 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.93 to 26.82 -RRB- . Delirium in older surgical ICU patients is associated with complications and an increased likelihood of discharge to a place other than home .	We enrolled patients aged 65 years or older , who were admitted to intensive care units after non-cardiac surgery , with dexmedetomidine -LRB- 34 -LSB- 10 % -RSB- of 350 patients ; 0 ratio -LSB- OR -RSB- 0 · 35 , 95 % CI 0 · 22-0 · 54 ; p < 0 · 0001 -RRB- . The incidence of hypertension was significantly higher in the hospital group -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- . The mean incidence of postoperative dexmedetomidine group had a type II error of the experimental intervention . The incidence rate of 20 % -LRB- power % -RSB- , P = 0.02 -RRB- , dexmedetomidine -LRB- n = 350 -RRB- , respectively , and the mean difference were found between the two groups . Exclusion criteria will be adult patients who are comatose at admission and patients with conditions requiring therapeutic coma -LRB- i.e. , severe head trauma , status epilepticus , patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia , patients with severe hypoxia -RRB- . Delirium is a postoperative complication that occurs frequently in patients older than 65 years , and presages adverse outcomes . Delirium patients with critically ill patients with mechanical ventilation are not yet certain .
26	negative	conflict	There were 10 cerebral infarctions and 1 intracerebral hematoma in the standard-care group	There were 10 to these patients had recurrent stroke 2 or more years after the initial event 	To test the hypothesis that children with sickle cell disease -LRB- SCD -RRB- who have an initial stroke temporally unrelated to another medical event are at higher risk for recurrent stroke than are children who had strokes temporally related to medical events . A retrospective cohort study of children with SCD and stroke who received regularly scheduled blood transfusions for a minimum of 5 years was conducted . Medical records were examined for the documentation of antecedent or concurrent medical events -LRB- hypertension , acute chest syndrome , aplastic crisis , fever associated with infection , exchange transfusion -RRB- associated with physician contact within 14 days before the initial stroke . A total of 137 pediatric patients from 14 centers were studied . Mean age at first stroke was 6.3 years -LRB- 1.4 to 14.0 years -RRB- with mean follow-up of 10.1 years -LRB- 5 to 24 years -RRB- . Thirty-one -LRB- 22 % -RRB- patients had a second stroke -LRB- 2.2 per 100 patient years -RRB- ; 26 patients had an identified medical or concurrent event associated with their initial stroke . None of these patients had recurrent stroke 2 or more years after the initial event . The remaining 111 patients had an ongoing risk of recurrent stroke -LRB- 1.9 per 100 patient-years -RRB- despite long-term transfusions -LRB- P = .038 -RRB- . The absence of an antecedent or concurrent medical event associated with an initial stroke is a major risk factor for subsequent stroke while receiving regular transfusions . Children with sickle cell disease -LRB- SCD -RRB- and strokes receive blood transfusion therapy for secondary stroke prevention ; despite this , approximately 20 % experience second overt strokes . Given this rate of second overt strokes and the clinical significance of silent cerebral infarcts , we tested the hypothesis that silent cerebral infarcts occur among children with SCD being transfused for secondary stroke prevention . A prospective cohort enrolled children with SCD and overt strokes at 7 academic centers . Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain were scheduled approximately every 1 to 2 years ; studies were reviewed by a panel of neuroradiologists . Eligibility criteria included regularly scheduled blood transfusion therapy . Forty children were included ; mean pretransfusion hemoglobin S concentration was 29 % . Progressive cerebral infarcts occurred in 45 % -LRB- 18 of 40 children -RRB- while receiving chronic blood transfusion therapy ; 7 had second overt strokes and 11 had new silent cerebral infarcts . Worsening cerebral vasculopathy was associated with new cerebral infarction -LRB- overt or silent ; relative risk = 12.7 ; 95 % confidence interval , 2.65-60.5 , P = .001 -RRB- . Children with SCD and overt strokes receiving regular blood transfusion therapy experience silent cerebral infarcts at a higher rate than previously recognized . Additional therapies are needed for secondary stroke prevention in children with SCD . Blood transfusions prevent recurrent stroke in children with sickle cell anemia , but the value of transfusions in preventing a first stroke is unknown . We used transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to identify children with sickle cell anemia who were at high risk for stroke and then randomly assigned them to receive standard care or transfusions to prevent a first stroke . To enter the study , children with sickle cell anemia and no history of stroke had to have undergone two transcranial Doppler studies that showed that the time-averaged mean blood-flow velocity in the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery was 200 cm per second or higher . The patients were randomly assigned to receive standard care or transfusions to reduce the hemoglobin S concentration to less than 30 percent of the total hemoglobin concentration . The incidence of stroke -LRB- cerebral infarction or intracranial hemorrhage -RRB- was compared between the two groups . A total of 130 children -LRB- mean -LSB- + / - SD -RSB- age , 8.3 + / -3.3 years -RRB- were enrolled ; 63 were randomly assigned to receive transfusions and 67 to receive standard care . At base line , the transfusion group had a slightly lower mean hemoglobin concentration -LRB- 7.2 vs. 7.6 g per deciliter , P = 0.001 -RRB- and hematocrit -LRB- 20.4 vs. 21.7 percent , P = 0.002 -RRB- . Ten patients dropped out of the transfusion group , and two patients crossed over from the standard-care group to the transfusion group . There were 10 cerebral infarctions and 1 intracerebral hematoma in the standard-care group , as compared with 1 infarction in the transfusion group -- a 92 percent difference in the risk of stroke -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- . This result led to the early termination of the trial . Transfusion greatly reduces the risk of a first stroke in children with sickle cell anemia who have abnormal results on transcranial Doppler ultrasonography . To assess the impact of our transcranial Doppler ultrasonography -LRB- TCD -RRB- program on the incidence of first stroke and the rate of transfusion for stroke prevention in children with sickle cell disease . In this single-institution , retrospective study , we compared the incidence of stroke and of transfusion for stroke prevention in 475 patients observed in the 8-year period before instituting TCD screening with the rate in 530 children in the 8-year period after . The incidence of overt stroke in the pre-TCD period was 0.67 per 100 patient-years , compared with 0.06 per 100 patient-years in the post-TCD period -LRB- P < .0001 -RRB- . Of the 2 strokes in the post-TCD period , 1 occurred in a child too young for the screening protocol , and 1 occurred in a child with high velocities solely in the anterior cerebral arteries . Our program has been successful in reducing the rate of first overt stroke , but with increased use of transfusion . Additional modifications to screening might further reduce the risk of first stroke , and studies of alternative treatments may be beneficial . Although transcranial Doppler ultrasonography -LRB- TCD -RRB- screening is effective in identifying children with sickle cell anemia -LRB- SCA -RRB- who are at high risk of stroke , not all children are screened . In 2003 , we instituted a comprehensive TCD screening program designed to screen all at-risk children treated at our sickle cell center . We evaluated the efficacy of our program by comparing the number of patients screened per year and incidence of first stroke across three periods defined by TCD usage : -LRB- 1 -RRB- pre-dating TCD screening , -LRB- 2 -RRB- sporadic TCD screening , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- comprehensive TCD screening . During Period 2 , an average of 52 patients/year were screened . In Period 3 , an average of 95 patients/year were screened representing 99 % of the at-risk population . Eighteen strokes occurred in Period 1 , 22 in Period 2 and three in Period 3 . Furthermore , of the 25 patients in Periods 2 and 3 who had stroke , only six had received TCD screening -LRB- four in Period 2 , two in Period 3 -RRB- . These six either declined prophylactic transfusion therapy -LRB- n = 2 -RRB- , had co-existing stroke risk factors -LRB- n = 2 -RRB- , or did not return for appropriate TCD follow-up -LRB- n = 2 -RRB- . Therefore , strokes that occurred were not the result of a failure of TCD screening per se . It is possible to perform TCD screening of most children with SCA . TCD screening is effective in reducing first stroke incidence in these children . The success of primary stroke prevention for children with sickle cell disease -LRB- SCD -RRB- throughout the United States is unknown . Therefore , we aimed to generate national incidence rates of hospitalization for stroke in children with sickle cell disease -LRB- SCD -RRB- before and after publication of the Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia -LRB- STOP trial -RRB- in 1998 . We performed a retrospective trend analysis of the 1993-2009 Nationwide Inpatient Sample and Kids ' Inpatient Databases . Hospitalizations for SCD patients 0-18 years old with stroke were identified by ICD-9CM code . The primary outcome , the trend in annual incidence rate of hospitalization for stroke in children with SCD , was analyzed by linear regression . Incidence rates of hospitalization for stroke before and after 1998 were compared by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test . From 1993 to 2009 , 2,024 hospitalizations were identified for stroke . Using the mean annual incidence rate of hospitalization for stroke from 1993 to 1998 as the baseline , the rate decreased from 1993 to 2009 -LRB- point estimate = -0.022 / 100 patient years -LSB- 95 % CI , -0.039 , -0.005 -RSB- , P = 0.027 -RRB- . The mean annual incidence rate of hospitalization stroke decreased by 45 % from 0.51 per 100 patient years in 1993-1998 to 0.28 per 100 patient years in 1999-2009 -LRB- P = 0.008 -RRB- . Total hospital days and charges attributed to stroke also decreased by 45 % and 24 % , respectively . After publication of the STOP trial and hydroxyurea licensure in 1998 , the incidence of hospitalization for stroke in children with SCD decreased across the United States , suggesting that primary stroke prevention has been effective nationwide , but opportunity for improvement remains .	Blood transfusions prevent recurrent stroke in children with sickle cell anemia , but the value of transfusions in preventing a first stroke is unknown . The incidence of stroke -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , the transfusion group was significantly higher in the standard-care group . The transfusion group had a significant reduction in the transfusion groups -LRB- mean difference , 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , P = 0.01 -RRB- . The absence of an antecedent or concurrent medical event associated with an initial stroke is a major risk factor for subsequent stroke while sickle cell disease -LRB- SCD -RRB- who have been assigned them to receive standard care or transfusions to prevent a care of the stroke . There were 10 to these patients had recurrent stroke 2 or more years after the initial event . The patients were randomly assigned to receive transfusions and overt strokes at 7 percent , compared with 0.06 per 100 patient-years in the post-TCD period , a 92 percent difference in the risk of transfusion children with their initial stroke or concurrent event solely in compared with 1 infarction in sickle cell prevention ; despite this , approximately 20 % experience second overt strokes .
27	positive	none			In iontophoresis experiments , a ` non-specific ' current-induced vasodilatation interferes with the effects of the diffused drugs . This current-induced vasodilatation is assumed to rely on an axon reflex due to excitation of cutaneous nociceptors and is weaker and delayed at the anode as compared to the cathode . We analysed whether these anodal specificities could result from a break excitation of nociceptors . Break excitation is the generation of action potentials at the end of a square anodal DC current application , which are generally weaker than those observed at the onset of a same application at the cathode . In eight healthy volunteers , we studied forearm cutaneous laser Doppler flow -LRB- LDF -RRB- responses to : -LRB- 1 -RRB- anodal and cathodal 100 microA current applications of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 or 5 min ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- 100 microA anodal applications of 3 min with a progressive ending over 100 s -LRB- total charge 23 mC -RRB- ; these were compared to square-ended 100 microA anodal applications of the same total charge -LRB- 23 mC -RRB- or duration -LRB- 3 min -RRB- ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- a 4 min 100 microA anodal application with a 333 msec break at half time . Results -LRB- mean + / - S.D. -RRB- are expressed as percentage of heat-induced maximal vasodilatation -LRB- % MVD -RRB- . Onset -LRB- T -LRB- vd -RRB- -RRB- and amplitude -LRB- LDF -LRB- peak -RRB- -RRB- of vasodilatation were determined . We observed that : T -LRB- vd -RRB- was linearly related to the duration of current application at the anode -LRB- slope = 1.01 , r -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 0.99 , P < 0.0001 -RRB- but not at the cathode -LRB- slope = 0.03 , r -LRB- 2 -RRB- = 0.02 , n.s. -RRB- . Progressive ending of anodal current did not decrease LDF -LRB- peak -RRB- -LRB- 63.3 + / - 24.6 % MVD -RRB- as compared to square-ending of current application of the same duration -LRB- 36.9 + / - 22.2 % MVD -RRB- or the same total charge -LRB- 57.1 + / - 23.5 % MVD -RRB- . A transient break of anodal current did not allow for the vasodilatation to develop until current was permanently stopped . We conclude that , during iontophoresis , anodal break excitation alone can not account for the delay and amplitude of the vascular response . The participation of prostaglandins -LRB- PGs -RRB- in the cutaneous vasodilatation to acetylcholine -LRB- ACh -RRB- applied via iontophoresis is under debate . Using laser Doppler flowmetry , we studied the long lasting effect -LRB- 20 min -RRB- of iontophoretic application -LRB- 30 s ; 0.1 mA -RRB- of ACh on the human forearm . Experiments were repeated -LRB- 1 -RRB- using deionized water instead of ACh to test the effect of current application , -LRB- 2 -RRB- after scopolamine treatment to inhibit muscarinic cholinergic receptors , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- 2 h , 3 days and 10 days following inhibition of PG synthesis with aspirin or a placebo control . Cutaneous vascular conductance -LRB- CVC -RRB- was calculated at rest -LRB- CVC -LRB- rest -RRB- -RRB- , at peak vasodilatation in the first 5 min following ACh iontophoresis -LRB- CVC -LRB- peak -RRB- -RRB- , and 20 min after iontophoresis -LRB- CVC -LRB- 20 -RRB- -RRB- . The minimal CVC -LRB- CVC -LRB- min -RRB- -RRB- following iontophoresis was also determined . Cutaneous response to ACh displayed a biphasic pattern with an early and transient peak -LRB- CVC -LRB- peak -RRB- : 62 + / - 8 % of the maximal CVC induced by local heating -LRB- MVC -RRB- -RRB- followed by a long lasting slower vasodilatation -LRB- CVC -LRB- min -RRB- : 44 + / - 6 ; CVC -LRB- 20 -RRB- : 56 + / - 5 % MVC -RRB- . The current itself had no major effect . Scopolamine almost abolished both phases . The long lasting phase was aspirin sensitive but not the transient phase . At hour 2 post-aspirin , CVC -LRB- peak -RRB- was 61 + / - 10 , CVC -LRB- min -RRB- 26 + / - 6 and CVC -LRB- 20 -RRB- 29 + / - 6 % MVC . At day 10 , CVC -LRB- peak -RRB- was 67 + / - 10 , CVC -LRB- min -RRB- 47 + / - 7 and CVC -LRB- 20 -RRB- 50 + / - 8 % MVC . We conclude that PGs participate in the vasodilator response following ACh iontophoresis . Previous non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatments must be taken into account when studying the effect of ACh iontophoresis . We previously reported that forearm vasodilation to a delivered all-at-once over 5 min or a 1-min repeated monopolar anodal 0.10-mA current application is aspirin sensitive and that a single high-dose aspirin exerts a long-lived effect in the former case . We hypothesized that 1 -RRB- in the latter case , the effect of aspirin would also be long lived and 2 -RRB- the time required to resupply nerve endings with unblocked cyclooxygenase through axonal transport could explain this phenomenon . We studied the time course for the recovery of vasodilation to repeated current application after placebo or 1-g aspirin treatment . We then searched for a difference at a proximal vs. distal site in the recovery of the response . Aspirin abolished current-induced vasodilation at 2 h , 10 h , and 3 days , with a progressive recovery thereafter , but no difference between distal and proximal site was observed for the recovery of the response . This suggests that , although neural cyclooxygenase could participate in the response , the time course of aspirin inhibition of current-induced cutaneous vasodilation is not due to the time required through neural transport to resupply nerve endings with unblocked proteins . 1 Acetyl salicyclic acid -LRB- aspirin -RRB- irreversibly blocks cyclo-oxygenase -LRB- COX -RRB- . This effect is short-lived in endothelial or smooth muscle cells due to resynthesis but long-lived in platelets devoid of synthesis ability . Aspirin blocks the anodal current-induced vasodilatation , suggesting participation by prostaglandin -LRB- PG -RRB- . We analysed the time course of the effect of aspirin as an indirect indicator of the origin of the PG possibly involved in anodal current-induced vasodilatation . 2 In healthy volunteers , vasodilatation , estimated from the peak cutaneous vascular conductance -LRB- CVC -LRB- peak -RRB- -RRB- , was recorded in the forearm during and in the 20 min following 5 min , 0.10 mA transcutaneous anodal current application , using deionized water as a vehicle . CVC -LRB- peak -RRB- was normalized to 44 degrees C heat-induced maximal vasodilatation and expressed in per cent values . Experiments were performed before and at 2 and 10 h , 3 , 7 , 10 and 14 days after blinded 1-g aspirin or placebo treatment . 3 CVC -LRB- peak -RRB- -LRB- mean + / - s.d.mean -RRB- after aspirin vs placebo was 13.6 + / -14.5 vs 65.0 + / -32.1 -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- 14.7 + / -4.2 vs 87.5 + / -31.9 -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- , 18.1 + / -10.2 vs 71.6 + / -26.8 -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- , 42.5 + / -23.4 vs 73.3 + / -26.8 -LRB- non significant , NS -RRB- , 60.2 + / -24.3 vs 75.2 + / -26.9 -LRB- NS -RRB- , 52.1 + / -18.5 vs 67.9 + / -32.1 -LRB- NS -RRB- at 2 and 10 h and at days 3 , 7 , 10 and 14 respectively . 4 Aspirin inhibition of anodal current-induced vasodilatation persists long after endothelial and smooth muscle cyclo-oxygenases are assumed to be restored . This suggests that the PG involved in this response are not endothelial - or smooth muscle-derived . The underlying mechanism of this unexpected long-lived inhibition of vasodilatation by single high dose aspirin remains to be studied . The vasodilatation resulting from prolonged square-wave monopolar current application as used in iontophoresis is assumed to rely on an axon reflex . Involvement of prostaglandins in the anodal current-induced vasodilatation remains unclear . We tested the hypothesis that prostaglandins participate in a sensitisation mechanism to current application rather than as direct vasodilators . In healthy volunteers , laser Doppler flowmetry -LRB- LDF -RRB- was recorded in the forearm during and following isolated or repeated 0.1 mA transcutaneous anodal current applications , using deionised water as a vehicle . Segmented current applications of 6 or 12 mC resulted in an LDF increase twice that observed following current applications of comparable total charge delivered all at once -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- . Following a 1 min anodal application , a slow and prolonged LDF drift occurred -LRB- slope : 0.3 + / - 0.5 arbitrary units min -LRB- -1 -RRB- -RRB- . When the same current application was repeated after intervals of 5 and 20 min , an abrupt vasodilatation occurred , with maximal LDF amplitude of 53.5 + / - 34.0 and 48.2 + / - 19.1 arbitrary units , respectively . Pretreatment with 1 g oral aspirin abolished the abrupt vasodilatation to repeated current application but not the initial slow drift . We suggest that vasodilatation occurs through two parallel pathways : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a slow progressive drift of LDF of limited amplitude insensitive to aspirin pretreatment , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- an abrupt vasodilatation probably resulting from afferent fibre activation , appearing if a preliminary sensitisation by current application is performed . Sensitisation lasts for at least 20 min , and is blocked by aspirin , suggesting participation of prostanoids .	We then searched for a difference at a proximal vs. distal site was observed for the recovery of the response . The mean + / - S.D. -RRB- of the cutaneous response -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , and no difference between distal and proximal site -LRB- P = 0.01 -RRB- . The mean peak vasodilatation -LRB- peak -RRB- , at the end of the recovery group , the response of aspirin -LRB- peak score , 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , respectively -RRB- . The minimal itself had no major effect of aspirin inhibition of cutaneous nociceptors and is associated with delayed at the cathode -LRB- slope = 0.03 -RRB- . We conclude that PGs treatments must be taken into account when studying the effect of ACh or 1-g cyclooxygenase through axonal transport could explain this phenomenon for placebo or 1-g aspirin endings with unblocked nerve endings with iontophoresis is under the anode as compared to the cathode instead in the former case to resupply muscarinic cholinergic receptors , and -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- and cathodal 100 microA current applications of 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 min ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- 100 microA anodal .
28	negative	conflict	Median progression-free survival was 6.4 months 	Median time to progression was 5.4 months	To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of irinotecan and oxaliplatin plus 5-fluorouracil -LRB- FU -RRB- and leucovorin -LRB- FOLFIRINOX -RRB- as second-line therapy in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma -LRB- MPA -RRB- . We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 27 patients with MPA treated with FOLFIRINOX as second-line therapy between January 2003 and November 2009 in our hospital . The recommended schedule was oxaliplatin 85 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- on day 1 + irinotecan 180 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- on day 1 + leucovorin 400 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- on day 1 followed by FU 400 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- as a bolus on day 1 and 2,400 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- as 46-hour continuous infusion biweekly . The median age of the 27 patients -LRB- 13 males and 14 females -RRB- was 63 years -LRB- 45-83 -RRB- . All patients had progressive disease after first-line chemotherapy by gemcitabine . A total of 167 cycles were administered , with a median number of 6 cycles -LRB- 1-29 -RRB- per patient . One toxic death occurred -LRB- sepsis -RRB- . Tolerance of treatment was acceptable , and the relative dose density delivered per patient was 92.8 % for oxaliplatin , 89.1 % for irinotecan and 96.4 % for FU . Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 55.6 % of the patients , including 1 febrile neutropenia . The other toxicities were manageable . Regarding efficacy , 22 of the 27 patients were evaluable -LRB- WHO and RECIST criteria -RRB- . Five patients had partial responses and 12 stable disease , resulting in an overall disease control rate of 63 % . Median time to progression was 5.4 months -LRB- 0.7-25.48 -RRB- , and median event-free survival was 3 months -LRB- 0.5-24.9 -RRB- . Median overall survival was 8.5 months -LRB- 0-26 -RRB- . A clinical benefit was reported for 55 % of the patients . These results confirmed the good safety profile and the efficacy of the FOLFIRINOX regimen as second-line treatment of MPA . Data are lacking on the efficacy and safety of a combination chemotherapy regimen consisting of oxaliplatin , irinotecan , fluorouracil , and leucovorin -LRB- FOLFIRINOX -RRB- as compared with gemcitabine as first-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer . We randomly assigned 342 patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0 or 1 -LRB- on a scale of 0 to 5 , with higher scores indicating a greater severity of illness -RRB- to receive FOLFIRINOX -LRB- oxaliplatin , 85 mg per square meter of body-surface area ; irinotecan , 180 mg per square meter ; leucovorin , 400 mg per square meter ; and fluorouracil , 400 mg per square meter given as a bolus followed by 2400 mg per square meter given as a 46-hour continuous infusion , every 2 weeks -RRB- or gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter weekly for 7 of 8 weeks and then weekly for 3 of 4 weeks . Six months of chemotherapy were recommended in both groups in patients who had a response . The primary end point was overall survival . The median overall survival was 11.1 months in the FOLFIRINOX group as compared with 6.8 months in the gemcitabine group -LRB- hazard ratio for death , 0.57 ; 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , 0.45 to 0.73 ; P < 0.001 -RRB- . Median progression-free survival was 6.4 months in the FOLFIRINOX group and 3.3 months in the gemcitabine group -LRB- hazard ratio for disease progression , 0.47 ; 95 % CI , 0.37 to 0.59 ; P < 0.001 -RRB- . The objective response rate was 31.6 % in the FOLFIRINOX group versus 9.4 % in the gemcitabine group -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- . More adverse events were noted in the FOLFIRINOX group ; 5.4 % of patients in this group had febrile neutropenia . At 6 months , 31 % of the patients in the FOLFIRINOX group had a definitive degradation of the quality of life versus 66 % in the gemcitabine group -LRB- hazard ratio , 0.47 ; 95 % CI , 0.30 to 0.70 ; P < 0.001 -RRB- . As compared with gemcitabine , FOLFIRINOX was associated with a survival advantage and had increased toxicity . FOLFIRINOX is an option for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer and good performance status . -LRB- Funded by the French government and others ; ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00112658 . -RRB- . Assessment of the change in tumour burden is an important feature of the clinical evaluation of cancer therapeutics : both tumour shrinkage -LRB- objective response -RRB- and disease progression are useful endpoints in clinical trials . Since RECIST was published in 2000 , many investigators , cooperative groups , industry and government authorities have adopted these criteria in the assessment of treatment outcomes . However , a number of questions and issues have arisen which have led to the development of a revised RECIST guideline -LRB- version 1.1 -RRB- . Evidence for changes , summarised in separate papers in this special issue , has come from assessment of a large data warehouse -LRB- > 6500 patients -RRB- , simulation studies and literature reviews . HIGHLIGHTS OF REVISED RECIST 1.1 : Major changes include : Number of lesions to be assessed : based on evidence from numerous trial databases merged into a data warehouse for analysis purposes , the number of lesions required to assess tumour burden for response determination has been reduced from a maximum of 10 to a maximum of five total -LRB- and from five to two per organ , maximum -RRB- . Assessment of pathological lymph nodes is now incorporated : nodes with a short axis of 15 mm are considered measurable and assessable as target lesions . The short axis measurement should be included in the sum of lesions in calculation of tumour response . Nodes that shrink to < 10 mm short axis are considered normal . Confirmation of response is required for trials with response primary endpoint but is no longer required in randomised studies since the control arm serves as appropriate means of interpretation of data . Disease progression is clarified in several aspects : in addition to the previous definition of progression in target disease of 20 % increase in sum , a 5 mm absolute increase is now required as well to guard against over calling PD when the total sum is very small . Furthermore , there is guidance offered on what constitutes ` unequivocal progression ' of non-measurable/non-target disease , a source of confusion in the original RECIST guideline . Finally , a section on detection of new lesions , including the interpretation of FDG-PET scan assessment is included . Imaging guidance : the revised RECIST includes a new imaging appendix with updated recommendations on the optimal anatomical assessment of lesions . A key question considered by the RECIST Working Group in developing RECIST 1.1 was whether it was appropriate to move from anatomic unidimensional assessment of tumour burden to either volumetric anatomical assessment or to functional assessment with PET or MRI . It was concluded that , at present , there is not sufficient standardisation or evidence to abandon anatomical assessment of tumour burden . The only exception to this is in the use of FDG-PET imaging as an adjunct to determination of progression . As is detailed in the final paper in this special issue , the use of these promising newer approaches requires appropriate clinical validation studies . The adaptation of pancreatic cancer cells to limited oxygen delivery promotes the induction of an invasive and treatment-resistant phenotype , triggering metastases at an early stage of tumor development , which resist in most cases adjuvant therapies following tumor resection . In this article , the authors summarize the evidence demonstrating the significance of hypoxia in pancreatic cancer pathogenesis and discuss the possible hypoxia-induced mechanisms underlying its aggressive nature . We then conclude with promising strategies that target hypoxia-adapted pancreatic cancer cells . Survival improvement for pancreatic cancer has not been observed in the last 4 decades . We report the most up-to-date population-based relative survival -LRB- RS -RRB- estimates and recent trends in Germany and the United States . Data for patients diagnosed in 1997 to 2010 and followed up to 2010 were drawn from 12 population-based German cancer registries and the US SEER -LRB- Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results -RRB- 13 registries database . Using period analysis , 5-year RS for 2007 to 2010 was derived . Model-based period analysis was used to assess 5-year RS time trends , 2002-2010 . In total 28,977 -LRB- Germany -RRB- and 34,793 -LRB- United States -RRB- patients aged 15 to 74 years were analyzed . Five-year RS was 10.7 % and 10.3 % in Germany and the United States , respectively , and strongly decreased with age and tumor spread . Prognosis slightly improved from the period 2002-2004 to 2008-2010 -LRB- overall age-adjusted RS : +2.5 % units in Germany and +3.4 % units in the United States -RRB- ; improvement was particularly strong for regional stage and head and body subsites in Germany and for localized and regional stages and tail subsite in the United States . Although pancreatic cancer survival continues to be poor for advanced-stage patients , our study disclosed encouraging indications of first improvements in 5-year RS after decades of stagnation . To provide evidence-based recommendations to oncologists and others for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer . American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an Expert Panel of medical oncology , radiation oncology , surgical oncology , gastroenterology , palliative care , and advocacy experts to conduct a systematic review of the literature from April 2004 to June 2015 . Outcomes were overall survival , disease-free survival , progression-free survival , and adverse events . Twenty-four randomized controlled trials met the systematic review criteria . A multiphase computed tomography scan of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis should be performed . Goals of care , patient preferences , treatment response , psychological status , support systems , and symptom burden should guide decisions for treatments . A palliative care referral should occur at first visit . FOLFIRINOX -LRB- leucovorin , fluorouracil , irinotecan , and oxaliplatin ; favorable comorbidity profile -RRB- or gemcitabine plus nanoparticle albumin-bound -LRB- NAB -RRB- - paclitaxel -LRB- adequate comorbidity profile -RRB- should be offered to patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status -LRB- ECOG PS -RRB- 0 to 1 based on patient preference and support system available . Gemcitabine alone is recommended for patients with ECOG PS 2 or with a comorbidity profile that precludes other regimens ; the addition of capecitabine or erlotinib may be offered . Patients with an ECOG PS ≥ 3 and poorly controlled comorbid conditions should be offered cancer-directed therapy only on a case-by-case basis ; supportive care should be emphasized . For second-line therapy , gemcitabine plus NAB-paclitaxel should be offered to patients with first-line treatment with FOLFIRINOX , an ECOG PS 0 to 1 , and a favorable comorbidity profile ; fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin , irinotecan , or nanoliposomal irinotecan should be offered to patients with first-line treatment with gemcitabine plus NAB-paclitaxel , ECOG PS 0 to 1 , and favorable comorbidity profile , and gemcitabine or fluorouracil should be offered to patients with either an ECOG PS 2 or a comorbidity profile that precludes other regimens .

Six genetic families of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase -LRB- CA , EC 4.2.1.1 -RRB- were described to date . Inhibition of CAs has pharmacologic applications in the field of antiglaucoma , anticonvulsant , anticancer , and anti-infective agents . New classes of CA inhibitors -LRB- CAIs -RRB- were described in the last decade with enzyme inhibition mechanisms differing considerably from the classical inhibitors of the sulfonamide or anion type . Five different CA inhibition mechanisms are known : -LRB- i -RRB- the zinc binders coordinate to the catalytically crucial Zn -LRB- II -RRB- ion from the enzyme active site , with the metal in tetrahedral or trigonal bipyramidal geometries . Sulfonamides and their isosters , most anions , dithiocarbamates and their isosters , carboxylates , and hydroxamates bind in this way ; -LRB- ii -RRB- inhibitors that anchor to the zinc-coordinated water molecule/hydroxide ion -LRB- phenols , carboxylates , polyamines , 2-thioxocoumarins , sulfocoumarins -RRB- ; -LRB- iii -RRB- inhibitors which occlude the entrance to the active site cavity -LRB- coumarins and their isosters -RRB- , this binding site coinciding with that where CA activators bind ; -LRB- iv -RRB- compounds which bind out of the active site cavity -LRB- a carboxylic acid derivative was seen to inhibit CA in this manner -RRB- , and -LRB- v -RRB- compounds for which the inhibition mechanism is not known , among which the secondary/tertiary sulfonamides as well as imatinib/nilotinib are the most investigated examples . As CAIs are used clinically in many pathologies , with a sulfonamide inhibitor -LRB- SLC-0111 -RRB- in Phase I clinical trials for the management of metastatic solid tumors , this review updates the recent findings in the field which may be useful for a structure-based drug design approach of more selective/potent modulators of the activity of these enzymes . In a phase 1-2 trial of albumin-bound paclitaxel -LRB- nab-paclitaxel -RRB- plus gemcitabine , substantial clinical activity was noted in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer . We conducted a phase 3 study of the efficacy and safety of the combination versus gemcitabine monotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer . Patients received the study treatment until disease progression . The primary end point was overall survival ; secondary end points were progression-free survival and overall response rate . A total of 861 patients were randomly assigned to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine -LRB- 431 patients -RRB- or gemcitabine -LRB- 430 -RRB- . The median overall survival was 8.5 months in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group as compared with 6.7 months in the gemcitabine group -LRB- hazard ratio for death , 0.72 ; 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , 0.62 to 0.83 ; P < 0.001 -RRB- . The survival rate was 35 % in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group versus 22 % in the gemcitabine group at 1 year , and 9 % versus 4 % at 2 years . The median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group , as compared with 3.7 months in the gemcitabine group -LRB- hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.69 ; 95 % CI , 0.58 to 0.82 ; P < 0.001 -RRB- ; the response rate according to independent review was 23 % versus 7 % in the two groups -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- . The most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia -LRB- 38 % in the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group vs. 27 % in the gemcitabine group -RRB- , fatigue -LRB- 17 % vs. 7 % -RRB- , and neuropathy -LRB- 17 % vs. 1 % -RRB- . Febrile neutropenia occurred in 3 % versus 1 % of the patients in the two groups . In the nab-paclitaxel-gemcitabine group , neuropathy of grade 3 or higher improved to grade 1 or lower in a median of 29 days . In patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma , nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine significantly improved overall survival , progression-free survival , and response rate , but rates of peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression were increased . -LRB- Funded by Celgene ; ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00844649 . -RRB- .

The median overall survival was observed in the FOLFIRINOX group -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- , and overall survival of the gemcitabine was significantly higher in the two groups . There was no significant differences between groups in the median overall groups .

29	negative	conflict	however 	To confirm the immunological basis of type I diabetes and to determine if immune intervention alters the course of the disease , we studied the use of cyclosporine in a 1-year randomized , double-masked , placebo-controlled trial in 23 subjects enrolled within 6 weeks of diagnosis . Subjects included 12 males and 11 females , ages 9-38 years -LRB- mean , 19.7 + / - 1.8 years -RRB- . Initial dosage of cyclosporine was 10 mg/kg/day , given as a single daily dose , adjusted on the basis of side effects and trough cyclosporine levels . Glycemic control and insulin dosage were similar in both cyclosporine and placebo groups . The frequency of freedom from insulin usage also was similar in both groups ; however , it is not possible to draw conclusions about response rates , because of the very small sample size . Glucose tolerance , as measured by rate of intravenous glucose disposal did not differ between groups . Moreover , acute insulin response to intravenous glucose was not restored in any subject . On the other hand , in comparison to the placebo group , the cyclosporine group did show an increased meal-stimulated C-peptide response after 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months . When measured by regression analysis , the slope defining the rate of decline of beta cell function was significantly slower for the cyclosporine group than the placebo group -LRB- p less than 0.05 -RRB- . Thus , as measured in response to a physiological stimulus -LRB- meal challenge -RRB- , cyclosporine preserves islet beta cell function when used in recent onset type I diabetes . Side effects were minimal and reversible upon cessation of immune intervention . The preservation of islet beta cell function by immune intervention is consistent with the hypothesis that type I diabetes has an immune mechanism involved in its pathogenesis .

30	positive	none			Penile cancer is a disease with a high morbidity and mortality . Its prevalence is relatively rare , but the highest in some developing countries . Insight into its precursor lesions , pathogenesis and risk factors offers options to prevent this potentially mutilating disease . This review presents an overview of the different histologically and clinically identified precursor lesions of penile cancer and discusses the molecular pathogenesis , including the role of HPV in penile cancer development . A systematic review of the literature evaluating penile carcinogenesis , risk factors and molecular mechanisms involved . Careful monitoring of men with lichen sclerosis , genital Bowen 's disease , erythroplasia of Queyrat and bowenoid papulosis seems useful , thereby offering early recognition of penile cancer and , subsequently , conservative therapeutic options . Special attention is given to flat penile lesions , which contain high numbers of HPV . Their role in HPV transmission to sexual partners is highlighted , but their potential to transform as a precursor lesion into penile cancer has been unsatisfactorily explored . Further research should not only focus on HPV mediated pathogenic pathways but also on the non-HPV related molecular and genetic factors that play a role in penile cancer development . Options for prevention of penile cancer include -LRB- neonatal -RRB- circumcision , limitation of penile HPV infections -LRB- either by prophylactic vaccination or condom use -RRB- , prevention of phimosis , treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions , limiting PUVA treatment , smoking cessation and hygienic measures . To examine trends in the incidence of primary , malignant penile cancer in the United States . A total of 1,817 men with primary , malignant penile cancer diagnosed between 1973 and 2002 from the Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results Program Public-use data were used for analysis . Incidence rates were calculated by clinical and demographic variables of interest and decade of diagnosis -LRB- 1973-1982 , 1983-1992 , and 1993-2002 -RRB- using Surveillance , Epidemiology and End Results-Stat 6.1 , and trends were examined using the annual percent change statistic . Additional incidence calculations were performed to examine further racial/ethnic differences . The overall incidence of primary , malignant penile cancer from 1973 to 2002 was 0.69 per 100,000 . Incidence decreased significantly over time : 0.84 per 100,000 in 1973-1982 to 0.69 per 100,000 in 1982-1992 to 0.58 per 100,000 in 1993-2002 . Incidence increased with increasing age at diagnosis . The majority of cases had squamous cell carcinomas , graded as I or II , and originated at the glans penis . Incidence of unknown grade primary , malignant penile cancer decreased significantly over the last 30 years , as did incidence of primary site penis , not otherwise specified primary , malignant penile cancer . The incidence of regional stage disease also increased over time . From 1993 to 2002 , White Hispanics had the highest incidence rates -LRB- 1.01 per 100,000 -RRB- followed by Alaska Native/American Indians -LRB- 0.77 per 100,000 -RRB- and Blacks -LRB- 0.62 per 100,000 -RRB- . The overall incidence of primary , malignant penile cancer in the United States has decreased , and these rates varied by race/ethnicity . Incidence rates increased with increasing age at diagnosis , and the incidence of regional stage disease increased over time , while incidence of unknown grade primary , malignant penile cancer decreased over the last 30 years . Penile carcinoma is a rare , male cancer . Although the incidence of penile carcinoma is very low in Western countries , in some countries , the incidence is significantly greater , with penile carcinoma accounting for ≤ 10 % of all male malignancies . Greater insight has been gained in recent years as to its pathogenesis , the risk factors associated with its development , and the clinical and histological precursor lesions related to this disease . In this review , risk and conditions factors for penile carcinoma , molecular alterations in this type of cancer , histological types , and prognostic factors will be discussed in order to further our understanding of the biology and behavior of this cancer . We assessed the oncological outcome of penile conserving surgery and identified parameters predicting local recurrence , including resection margins . A total of 179 patients with invasive penile cancer treated with organ sparing surgery at a tertiary center between 2002 and 2010 fulfilled our study criteria . Demographic , histopathological , management and followup data were recorded in a prospective database . Local , regional and distant recurrence rates , time to recurrence and survival rates were calculated . Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method . Multivariate analysis was used to identify predictors of local recurrence . Mean followup was 42.8 months -LRB- range 4 to 107 -RRB- . Local , regional and distant metastatic recurrence developed in 16 -LRB- 8.9 % -RRB- , 19 -LRB- 10.6 % -RRB- and 9 patients -LRB- 5.0 % -RRB- at a mean of 26.1 , 26.8 and 11.7 months , respectively . The 5-year disease specific survival rate after recurrence was 54.7 % -LRB- 95 % CI 46.1-63.3 -RRB- . For patients with isolated local recurrence the 5-year disease specific survival rate was 91.7 % compared to 38.4 % for those with regional recurrence . The overall 5-year local recurrence-free rate was 86.3 % -LRB- 95 % CI 82.6-90.4 -RRB- . Tumor grade -LRB- p = 0.003 -RRB- , stage -LRB- p = 0.021 -RRB- and lymphovascular invasion -LRB- p = 0.014 -RRB- were identified as predictors of local recurrence on multivariate analysis . Penile conserving surgery is oncologically safe and a surgical excision margin of less than 5 mm is adequate . Higher local recurrence rates are associated with lymphovascular invasion , and higher tumor stage and grade . Local recurrence has no negative impact on long-term survival . We present medium-term outcome data for patients with invasive penile cancer treated with glansectomy and reconstruction with a split-thickness skin graft . A series of consecutive patients referred with penile malignancies over a 6-yr period were analyzed prospectively . A dedicated histopathologist reviewed all the specimens . After clinical staging , patients with tumours confined to the glans were offered glansectomy . A total of 72 patients -LRB- 32 % of patients , 31 % of procedures -RRB- underwent glansectomy for penile carcinoma . Of these , 65 patients were new diagnoses and seven were recurrences after radiotherapy . The mean follow-up period was 27 mo -LRB- range : 4-68 mo -RRB- . There have been three late local recurrences -LRB- 4 % -RRB- . Glansectomy appears to be an oncologically safe and effective procedure for patients with glans-confined squamous cell tumours . It preserves maximum phallic length and results in a very satisfactory cosmetic penile appearance after reconstruction . What 's known on the subject ? and What does the study add ? Metastatic or locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the penis -LRB- SCCP -RRB- is generally incurable , but it can be palliated with systemic chemotherapy . Two retrospective studies , involving < 10 patients each , showed that cisplatin plus continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil -LRB- 5-FU -RRB- may be effective and well tolerated . Cisplatin , methotrexate and bleomycin , cisplatin and irinotecan and taxanes can also play an important role for patients with locally advanced/metastatic SCCP . Finally , anti-EGFR therapy may also be effective in advanced SCCP . Although cisplatin plus continuous infusion of 5-FU is widely used in clinical practice for palliation of SCCP , toxicity and efficacy data regarding this schedule include a total of 14 patients with SCCP , treated more than two decades ago . In our retrospective study , cisplatin plus continuous infusion of 5-FU was used for palliative purposes in a homogenous sample of 25 patients with SCCP . Partial responses and stable disease were observed in 8 -LRB- 32 % -RRB- and 10 -LRB- 40 % -RRB- patients , respectively , with a median progression-free survival of 20 weeks . Neutropenia was the most important grade 3-4 side effect observed , occurring in 20 % of patients . These data provide confirmation that such a combination regimen is moderately effective and well tolerated in patients with SCCP . • To investigate the activity and toxicity of 5-fluorouracil -LRB- 5-FU -RRB- as a first-line treatment in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the penis -LRB- SCCP -RRB- . • The medical records of 78 patients with SCCP treated between January 2000 and June 2011 at the four participating centres were reviewed . • Data regarding patients treated with first-line 5-FU were extracted . • Patients were included in the study if radiological reports were available for determination of response and progression-free survival -LRB- PFS -RRB- according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumours -LRB- RECIST -RRB- 1.1 . • Between January 2000 and June 2011 , 25 patients were treated with i.v. cisplatin on day 1 followed by 5-FU as a continuous 24-h infusion for 4 days every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . Partial responses and stable disease were observed in eight -LRB- 32 % -RRB- and 10 -LRB- 40 % -RRB- patients , respectively , with a disease control rate of 72 % . • Severe neutropenia was the most important grade 3-4 side effect observed , occurring in 20 % of patients . • The median -LRB- interquartile range -LSB- IQR -RSB- -RRB- PFS was 20 -LRB- 11-20 -RRB- weeks and the median -LRB- IQR -RRB- overall survival -LRB- OS -RRB- was 8 -LRB- 7-12 -RRB- months . • 5-FU is associated with a moderate response rate and is well tolerated in patients with metastatic SCCP . We ascertained whether combined cisplatin , methotrexate and bleomycin have efficacy for treating locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma of the penis , and evaluate the toxicity resulting from this regimen . Patients had biopsy proved locally advanced or metastatic epidermoid carcinoma of the penis . Chemotherapy consisted of 75 mg . / m. 2 cisplatin infused intravenously on day 1 , 25 mg . / m. 2 intravenous bolus of methotrexate on days 1 and 8 , and 10 unit per m. 2 intravenous bolus of bleomycin on days 1 and 8 with a cycle length of 21 days . Our study was performed as a standard phase II evaluation with 2 stages of accrual . Enrolled in this study were 45 patients , including 40 who were evaluable for a response . There were 5 complete and 8 partial responses for a 32.5 % response rate . Five treatment related deaths occurred and 6 of the 36 remaining patients evaluable for toxicity had 1 or more life threatening toxic episodes . A regimen of cisplatin , methotrexate and bleomycin appears to have promising results . However , toxicity was prodigious , and an emphasis of future research should be to decrease toxicity . Men with penile squamous cell carcinoma and regional lymph node involvement have a low probability of survival with lymphadenectomy alone . A multimodal approach to treatment is desirable for such patients . We performed a phase II study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the objective of determining the response rate , time to progression -LRB- TTP -RRB- , and overall survival -LRB- OS -RRB- among patients with bulky adenopathy . Eligible patients had stage N2 or N3 -LRB- stage III or stage IV -RRB- penile cancer without distant metastases . Neoadjuvant treatment -LRB- four courses every 3-4 weeks -RRB- consisted of paclitaxel 175 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- administered over 3 hours on day 1 ; ifosfamide 1,200 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- on days 1 to 3 ; and cisplatin 25 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- on days 1 to 3 . Clinical and pathologic responses were assessed , and patient groups were compared for TTP and OS . Thirty men received chemotherapy of whom 15 -LRB- 50.0 % -RRB- had an objective response and 22 -LRB- 73.3 % -RRB- subsequently underwent surgery . Three patients had no remaining tumor on histopathology . Improved TTP and OS were significantly associated with a response to chemotherapy -LRB- P < .001 and P = .001 , respectively -RRB- , absence of bilateral residual tumor -LRB- P = .002 and P = .017 , respectively -RRB- , and absence of extranodal extension -LRB- P = .001 and P = .004 , respectively -RRB- or skin involvement -LRB- P = .009 and P = .012 , respectively -RRB- . The neoadjuvant regimen of paclitaxel , ifosfamide , and cisplatin induced clinically meaningful responses in patients with bulky regional lymph node metastases from penile cancer . The knowledge of somatic mutations that arise in penile cancer is limited . We examined the dysregulation of components in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Ras pathways . Using single stranded conformational analysis and direct sequencing we performed mutational analysis of the PIK3CA , PTEN , HRAS , KRAS , NRAS and BRAF genes in 28 penile tumors . We identified somatic missense mutations in 11 of the 28 penile cancer samples -LRB- 39 % -RRB- . In the PIK3CA gene 8 mutations -LRB- 29 % -RRB- were identified that were E542K or E545K . In the HRAS gene a G12S and a Q61L mutation were found -LRB- 7 % -RRB- . The KRAS gene contained 1 mutation -LRB- 3 % -RRB- , that is a G12S change . The mutations were mutually exclusive , suggesting that dysregulation of either pathway is sufficient for the development and progression of penile carcinoma . The high frequency of mutations in the PIK3CA , HRAS and KRAS genes leads us to believe that dysregulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Ras pathway is significant for the development and progression of penile carcinoma . We conducted a multinational , randomized study to compare radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus cetuximab , a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor , in the treatment of locoregionally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck . Patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer were randomly assigned to treatment with high-dose radiotherapy alone -LRB- 213 patients -RRB- or high-dose radiotherapy plus weekly cetuximab -LRB- 211 patients -RRB- at an initial dose of 400 mg per square meter of body-surface area , followed by 250 mg per square meter weekly for the duration of radiotherapy . The primary end point was the duration of control of locoregional disease ; secondary end points were overall survival , progression-free survival , the response rate , and safety . The median duration of locoregional control was 24.4 months among patients treated with cetuximab plus radiotherapy and 14.9 months among those given radiotherapy alone -LRB- hazard ratio for locoregional progression or death , 0.68 ; P = 0.005 -RRB- . With a median follow-up of 54.0 months , the median duration of overall survival was 49.0 months among patients treated with combined therapy and 29.3 months among those treated with radiotherapy alone -LRB- hazard ratio for death , 0.74 ; P = 0.03 -RRB- . Radiotherapy plus cetuximab significantly prolonged progression-free survival -LRB- hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.70 ; P = 0.006 -RRB- . With the exception of acneiform rash and infusion reactions , the incidence of grade 3 or greater toxic effects , including mucositis , did not differ significantly between the two groups . Treatment of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer with concomitant high-dose radiotherapy plus cetuximab improves locoregional control and reduces mortality without increasing the common toxic effects associated with radiotherapy to the head and neck . -LRB- ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00004227 . -RRB- The epidermal growth factor receptor -LRB- EGFR -RRB- , which participates in signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer cells , commonly appears on colorectal-cancer cells . Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically blocks the EGFR . We compared the efficacy of cetuximab in combination with irinotecan with that of cetuximab alone in metastatic colorectal cancer that was refractory to treatment with irinotecan . We randomly assigned 329 patients whose disease had progressed during or within three months after treatment with an irinotecan-based regimen to receive either cetuximab and irinotecan -LRB- at the same dose and schedule as in a prestudy regimen -LSB- 218 patients -RSB- -RRB- or cetuximab monotherapy -LRB- 111 patients -RRB- . In cases of disease progression , the addition of irinotecan to cetuximab monotherapy was permitted . The patients were evaluated radiologically for tumor response and were also evaluated for the time to tumor progression , survival , and side effects of treatment . The rate of response in the combination-therapy group was significantly higher than that in the monotherapy group -LRB- 22.9 percent -LSB- 95 percent confidence interval , 17.5 to 29.1 percent -RSB- vs. 10.8 percent -LSB- 95 percent confidence interval , 5.7 to 18.1 percent -RSB- , P = 0.007 -RRB- . The median time to progression was significantly greater in the combination-therapy group -LRB- 4.1 vs. 1.5 months , P < 0.001 by the log-rank test -RRB- . The median survival time was 8.6 months in the combination-therapy group and 6.9 months in the monotherapy group -LRB- P = 0.48 -RRB- . Toxic effects were more frequent in the combination-therapy group , but their severity and incidence were similar to those that would be expected with irinotecan alone . Cetuximab has clinically significant activity when given alone or in combination with irinotecan in patients with irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancer . Use of cetuximab , a monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor -LRB- EGFR -RRB- , has the potential to increase survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer . We therefore compared chemotherapy plus cetuximab with chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced EGFR-positive non-small-cell lung cancer . In a multinational , multicentre , open-label , phase III trial , chemotherapy-naive patients -LRB- > or = 18 years -RRB- with advanced EGFR-expressing histologically or cytologically proven stage wet IIIB or stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to chemotherapy plus cetuximab or just chemotherapy . Chemotherapy was cisplatin 80 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- intravenous infusion on day 1 , and vinorelbine 25 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- intravenous infusion on days 1 and 8 of every 3-week cycle -RRB- for up to six cycles . Cetuximab-at a starting dose of 400 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- intravenous infusion over 2 h on day 1 , and from day 8 onwards at 250 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- over 1 h per week-was continued after the end of chemotherapy until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity had occurred . The primary endpoint was overall survival . Analysis was by intention to treat . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00148798 . Between October , 2004 , and January , 2006 , 1125 patients were randomly assigned to chemotherapy plus cetuximab -LRB- n = 557 -RRB- or chemotherapy alone -LRB- n = 568 -RRB- . Patients given chemotherapy plus cetuximab survived longer than those in the chemotherapy-alone group -LRB- median 11.3 months vs 10.1 months ; hazard ratio for death 0.871 -LSB- 95 % CI 0.762-0.996 -RSB- ; p = 0.044 -RRB- . The main cetuximab-related adverse event was acne-like rash -LRB- 57 -LSB- 10 % -RSB- of 548 , grade 3 -RRB- . Addition of cetuximab to platinum-based chemotherapy represents a new treatment option for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer . Merck KGaA . The epidermal growth factor -LRB- EGF -RRB- receptor is frequently overexpressed in epithelial tumors . C225 is a human-to-murine chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to the receptor and inhibits growth of cancer cells expressing the receptor . We evaluated the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of C225 in patients with advanced tumors overexpressing EGF receptors . We treated 52 patients in three successive phase I clinical trials of C225 as a single dose -LRB- n = 13 -RRB- , weekly multiple dose -LRB- n = 17 -RRB- , and weekly multiple dose with cisplatin -LRB- n = 22 -RRB- . C225 dose levels were 5 , 20 , 50 , and 100 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- . In the study combining C225 with cisplatin , limited to patients with either head and neck or non-small-cell lung cancer , C225 was further escalated to 200 and 400 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- . Cisplatin was given at a dose of 60 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- once every 4 weeks , and treatment was continued for up to 12 weeks if no disease progression occurred . C225 displayed nonlinear pharmacokinetics , with antibody doses in the range of 200 to 400 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- being associated with complete saturation of systemic clearance . C225 clearance did not change with repeated administration or with coadministration of cisplatin . Antibodies against C225 were detected in only one patient , and C225-associated toxicity was minimal . Patients experiencing disease stabilization were seen in all studies . In the study combining C225 and cisplatin , nine -LRB- 69 % -RRB- of 13 patients treated with antibody doses > / = 50 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- completed 12 weeks of therapy , and two partial responses were observed . C225 has dose-dependent pharmacokinetics , and doses that achieve saturation of systemic clearance are well tolerated . C225 given in combination with cisplatin has biologic activity at pharmacologically relevant doses . Previous results from our phase 3 randomised trial showed that adding cetuximab to primary radiotherapy increased overall survival in patients with locoregionally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck -LRB- LASCCHN -RRB- at 3 years . Here we report the 5-year survival data , and investigate the relation between cetuximab-induced rash and survival . Patients with LASCCHN of the oropharynx , hypopharynx , or larynx with measurable disease were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to receive either comprehensive head and neck radiotherapy alone for 6-7 weeks or radiotherapy plus weekly doses of cetuximab : 400 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- initial dose , followed by seven weekly doses at 250 mg/m -LRB- 2 -RRB- . Randomisation was done with an adaptive minimisation technique to balance assignments across stratification factors of Karnofsky performance score , T stage , N stage , and radiation fractionation . The trial was un-blinded . The primary endpoint was locoregional control , with a secondary endpoint of survival . Following discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration , the dataset was locked , except for queries to the sites about overall survival , before our previous report in 2006 , so that an independent review could be done . Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis . Following completion of treatment , patients underwent physical examination and radiographic imaging every 4 months for 2 years , and then every 6 months thereafter . The trial is registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00004227 . Patients were randomly assigned to receive radiotherapy with -LRB- n = 211 -RRB- or without -LRB- n = 213 -RRB- cetuximab , and all patients were followed for survival . Updated median overall survival for patients treated with cetuximab and radiotherapy was 49.0 months -LRB- 95 % CI 32.8-69.5 -RRB- versus 29.3 months -LRB- 20.6-41.4 -RRB- in the radiotherapy-alone group -LRB- hazard ratio -LSB- HR -RSB- 0.73 , 95 % CI 0.56-0.95 ; p = 0.018 -RRB- . 5-year overall survival was 45.6 % in the cetuximab-plus-radiotherapy group and 36.4 % in the radiotherapy-alone group . Additionally , for the patients treated with cetuximab , overall survival was significantly improved in those who experienced an acneiform rash of at least grade 2 severity compared with patients with no rash or grade 1 rash -LRB- HR 0.49 , 0.34-0.72 ; p = 0.002 -RRB- . For patients with LASCCHN , cetuximab plus radiotherapy significantly improves overall survival at 5 years compared with radiotherapy alone , confirming cetuximab plus radiotherapy as an important treatment option in this group of patients . Cetuximab-treated patients with prominent cetuximab-induced rash -LRB- grade 2 or above -RRB- have better survival than patients with no or grade 1 rash . ImClone Systems , Merck KGaA , and Bristol-Myers Squibb . Cetuximab is effective in platinum-resistant recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck . We investigated the efficacy of cetuximab plus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck . We randomly assigned 220 of 442 eligible patients with untreated recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck to receive cisplatin -LRB- at a dose of 100 mg per square meter of body-surface area on day 1 -RRB- or carboplatin -LRB- at an area under the curve of 5 mg per milliliter per minute , as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on day 1 -RRB- plus fluorouracil -LRB- at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter per day for 4 days -RRB- every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles and 222 patients to receive the same chemotherapy plus cetuximab -LRB- at a dose of 400 mg per square meter initially , as a 2-hour intravenous infusion , then 250 mg per square meter , as a 1-hour intravenous infusion per week -RRB- for a maximum of 6 cycles . Patients with stable disease who received chemotherapy plus cetuximab continued to receive cetuximab until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects , whichever occurred first . Adding cetuximab to platinum-based chemotherapy with fluorouracil -LRB- platinum-fluorouracil -RRB- significantly prolonged the median overall survival from 7.4 months in the chemotherapy-alone group to 10.1 months in the group that received chemotherapy plus cetuximab -LRB- hazard ratio for death , 0.80 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.64 to 0.99 ; P = 0.04 -RRB- . The addition of cetuximab prolonged the median progression-free survival time from 3.3 to 5.6 months -LRB- hazard ratio for progression , 0.54 ; P < 0.001 -RRB- and increased the response rate from 20 % to 36 % -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- . The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the chemotherapy-alone and cetuximab groups were anemia -LRB- 19 % and 13 % , respectively -RRB- , neutropenia -LRB- 23 % and 22 % -RRB- , and thrombocytopenia -LRB- 11 % in both groups -RRB- . Sepsis occurred in 9 patients in the cetuximab group and in 1 patient in the chemotherapy-alone group -LRB- P = 0.02 -RRB- . Of 219 patients receiving cetuximab , 9 % had grade 3 skin reactions and 3 % had grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions . There were no cetuximab-related deaths . As compared with platinum-based chemotherapy plus fluorouracil alone , cetuximab plus platinum-fluorouracil chemotherapy improved overall survival when given as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck . -LRB- ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00122460 . -RRB- To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the epidermal growth factor receptor-directed monoclonal antibody cetuximab administered as a single agent in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck -LRB- SCCHN -RRB- who experience disease progression on platinum therapy . An open-label multicenter study in which patients with disease progression on two to six cycles of platinum therapy received single-agent cetuximab -LRB- initial dose 400 mg/m2 followed by subsequent weekly doses of 250 mg/m2 -RRB- for > or = 6 weeks -LRB- single-agent phase -RRB- . Patients who experienced disease progression could receive salvage therapy with cetuximab plus platinum -LRB- combination-therapy phase -RRB- . From June 2001 to December 2002 , 103 patients were enrolled and treated with cetuximab , 53 of whom subsequently received combination therapy . In the single-agent phase , response rate was 13 % , disease control rate -LRB- complete response/partial response/stable disease -RRB- was 46 % , and median time to progression -LRB- TTP -RRB- was 70 days . During the combination-therapy phase , the objective response rate was zero , disease control rate was 26 % , and TTP was 50 days . Median overall survival was 178 days . Treatment was well tolerated . The most common cetuximab-related adverse events in the single-agent phase were skin reactions , particularly rash -LRB- 49 % of patients , mainly grade 1 or 2 -RRB- . There was one treatment-related death due to an infusion-related reaction . Single-agent cetuximab was active and generally well tolerated in the treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN that progressed on platinum therapy . Response was comparable to that seen with cetuximab plus platinum combination regimens in the same setting . Guidelines on the treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the penis are limited to a few prospective trials . Cisplatin-based regimens represent the standard of treatment with promising activity of taxanes . Recently , epidermal growth factor receptor overexpression has been shown in these patients . We treated an elderly man with a docetaxel-cetuximab combination after failure of the cisplatin regimen . We observed a necrosis of the inguinal lymph nodes and a reduction of -LRB- 18 -RRB- F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake at PET/CT scan . Only mild mucositis and skin toxicity had been detected . Our case report , the first in the literature , shows that this combination is active and well tolerated in penile squamous cell carcinoma . We investigated the efficacy of cetuximab plus irinotecan , fluorouracil , and leucovorin -LRB- FOLFIRI -RRB- as first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer and sought associations between the mutation status of the KRAS gene in tumors and clinical response to cetuximab . We randomly assigned patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-positive colorectal cancer with unresectable metastases to receive FOLFIRI either alone or in combination with cetuximab . The primary end point was progression-free survival . A total of 599 patients received cetuximab plus FOLFIRI , and 599 received FOLFIRI alone . The hazard ratio for progression-free survival in the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group as compared with the FOLFIRI group was 0.85 -LRB- 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , 0.72 to 0.99 ; P = 0.048 -RRB- . There was no significant difference in the overall survival between the two treatment groups -LRB- hazard ratio , 0.93 ; 95 % CI , 0.81 to 1.07 ; P = 0.31 -RRB- . There was a significant interaction between treatment group and KRAS mutation status for tumor response -LRB- P = 0.03 -RRB- but not for progression-free survival -LRB- P = 0.07 -RRB- or overall survival -LRB- P = 0.44 -RRB- . The hazard ratio for progression-free survival among patients with wild-type-KRAS tumors was 0.68 -LRB- 95 % CI , 0.50 to 0.94 -RRB- , in favor of the cetuximab-FOLFIRI group . The following grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI than with FOLFIRI alone : skin reactions -LRB- which were grade 3 only -RRB- -LRB- in 19.7 % vs. 0.2 % of patients , P < 0.001 -RRB- , infusion-related reactions -LRB- in 2.5 % vs. 0 % , P < 0.001 -RRB- , and diarrhea -LRB- in 15.7 % vs. 10.5 % , P = 0.008 -RRB- . First-line treatment with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI , as compared with FOLFIRI alone , reduced the risk of progression of metastatic colorectal cancer . The benefit of cetuximab was limited to patients with KRAS wild-type tumors . -LRB- ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00154102 . -RRB-	Greater insight has been gained in recent years , the risk factors associated with its development , and the clinical and histological precursor lesions related to this disease . The overall incidence of regional recurrence rates were 91.7 % -LRB- 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , P < 0.001 -RRB- . For patients with isolated local recurrence were significantly higher in the 26.1 group . The 5-year incidence of primary , malignant penile cancer in the United States has decreased , and these rates varied by race/ethnicity . Insight into its precursor lesions , pathogenesis and risk factors offers this type of cancer , histological types , and prognostic factors will be discussed in order to further our understanding of the literature evaluating penile lesion of penile cancer and discusses the molecular pathogenesis , including the role of HPV in penile cancer has been unsatisfactorily explored .

34	positive	none			As the modern era of cryosurgery began in the mid 1960s , the basic features of cryosurgical technique were established as rapid freezing , slow thawing , and repetition of the freeze-thaw cycle . Since then , new applications of cryosurgery have caused numerous investigations on the mechanism of injury in cryosurgery with the intent to better define appropriate or optimal temperature-time dosimetry of the freeze-thaw cycles . A diversity of opinion has become evident on some aspects of technique , but the basic tenets of cryosurgery remain unchanged . All the parts of the freeze-thaw cycle can cause tissue injury . The cooling rate should be as fast as possible , but it is not as critical as other factors . The coldest tissue temperature is the prime factor in cell death and this should be -50 degreesC in neoplastic tissue . The optimal duration of freezing is not known , but prolonged freezing increases tissue destruction . The thawing rate is a prime destructive factor and it should be as slow as possible . Repetition of the freeze-thaw cycle is well known to be an important factor in effective therapy . A prime need in cryosurgical research is related to the periphery of the cryosurgical lesion where some cells die and others live . Adjunctive therapy should influence the fate of cells in this region and increase the efficacy of cryosurgical techniques . In view of the increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma in Barrett 's esophagus and the mortality and high morbidity rates associated with surgical therapy for this condition , safe and effective but less invasive methods of treatment are needed . To evaluate efficacy and safety of endoscopic resection in these patients . Single-center prospective study . Teaching hospital , conducted between October 1996 and September 2003 . A total of 100 consecutive patients -LRB- mean age , 62.1 + / - 10.9 years ; range , 31-86 years -RRB- with low-risk adenocarcinoma of the esophagus -LRB- macroscopic types I , IIa , IIb , and IIc ; lesion diameter up to 20 mm ; mucosal lesion without invasion into lymph vessels and veins ; and histologic grades G1 and G2 -RRB- arising in Barrett 's metaplasia . Endoscopic resection with the suck-and-cut technique . Complete local remission . A total of 144 resections -LRB- 1.47 per patient -RRB- were performed without technical problems . No major complications and only 11 minor ones -LRB- bleedings without decrease of Hb > 2 g/dL ; treated with injection therapy -RRB- occurred . Complete local remission was achieved in 99 of the 100 patients after 1.9 months -LRB- range , 1-18 months -RRB- and a maximum of 3 resections . During a mean follow-up period of 36.7 months , recurrent or metachronous carcinomas were found in 11 % of the patients , but successful repeat treatment with endoscopic resection was possible in all of these cases . The calculated 5-year survival rate was 98 % . Two patients died of other causes . Nonblinded , nonrandomized study . Endoscopic resection is associated with favorable outcomes for low-risk patients with early esophageal adenocarcinoma -LRB- Barrett 's carcinoma -RRB- . In view of the mortality and morbidity rates of esophagectomy and the relatively large group of inoperable patients , local therapeutic techniques are required for high-grade dysplasia and early Barrett 's cancer . A prospective investigation of endoscopic mucosal resection was conducted in 64 patients -LRB- mean age , 65 + / - 10 years -RRB- who had early carcinoma -LRB- 61 patients -RRB- or high-grade dysplasia -LRB- 3 patients -RRB- in Barrett 's esophagus . Thirty-five patients met the criteria for low risk : macroscopic types I , IIa , IIb , and IIc ; lesion diameter up to 20 mm ; mucosal lesion ; and histological grades G1 and G2 and/or high-grade dysplasia -LRB- group A -RRB- . The remaining 29 patients were included in group B -LRB- high risk -RRB- . A total of 120 resections were performed , with no technical problems encountered . The mean number of treatment sessions per patient was 1 . 3 + / - 0.6 in group A and 2.8 + / - 2.0 in group B -LRB- P < 0.0005 -RRB- . Only one major complication occurred , a case of spurting bleeding , which was managed endoscopically . Complete local remission was achieved significantly earlier -LRB- P = 0.008 -RRB- in group A than in group B . In May 1999 , complete remission had been achieved in 97 % of the patients in group A and in 59 % of those in group B ; however , 1 patient in group A and 9 in group B are still undergoing treatment or awaiting the first check-up . During a mean follow-up of 12 + / - 8 months , recurrent or metachronous carcinomas were found in 14 % . Endoscopic mucosal resection of early carcinoma in Barrett 's esophagus is associated with promisingly low morbidity and mortality rates . The procedure may offer a new minimally invasive therapeutic alternative to esophagectomy , especially in low-risk situations . Comparisons with surgical results will need to be done when the long-term results of this procedure become available . Barrett 's esophagus -LRB- BE -RRB- may lead to high-grade dysplasia -LRB- HGD -RRB- and adenocarcinoma . The objective was to examine the impact of treating patients with BE and with HGD by using porfimer sodium -LRB- POR -RRB- and photodynamic therapy -LRB- PDT -RRB- for ablating HGD and reducing the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma . The design was a multicenter , partially blinded -LRB- pathology -RRB- , randomized clinical trial conducted in patients with BE who have HGD . There were 30 contributing centers . A total of 485 patients were screened , with 208 in the intent-to-treat population and 202 in the safety population . Patients were randomized on a 2:1 basis to compare PDT with POR plus omeprazole -LRB- PORPDT -RRB- with omeprazole only -LRB- OM -RRB- . The main outcome measurement was complete HGD ablation occurring at any time during the study period . There was a significant difference -LRB- p < 0.0001 -RRB- in favor of PORPDT -LRB- 106/138 -LSB- 77 % -RSB- -RRB- compared with OM -LRB- 27/70 -LSB- 39 % -RSB- -RRB- in complete ablation of HGD at any time during the study period . The occurrence of adenocarcinoma in the PORPDT group -LRB- 13 % -RRB- -LRB- n = 18 -RRB- was significantly lower -LRB- p < 0.006 -RRB- compared with the OM group -LRB- 28 % -RRB- -LSB- corrected -RSB- -LRB- n = 20 -RRB- . The safety profile showed 94 % of patients in the PORPDT group and 13 % of patients in the OM group had treatment-related adverse effects . The limitations of the study were that PDT therapy may have had to be applied more than once and that patients spent more time in treatment . The patients and the physicians were not blinded to the treatment . PORPDT in conjunction with omeprazole is an effective therapy for ablating HGD in patients with BE and in reducing the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma . Barrett 's esophagus -LRB- BE -RRB- with high-grade dysplasia -LRB- HGD -RRB- is a risk factor for development of esophageal carcinoma . Photodynamic therapy -LRB- PDT -RRB- with Photofrin -LRB- PHO -RRB- has been used to eliminate HGD in BE . Our purpose was to compare PHOPDT plus omeprazole with omeprazole only -LRB- OM -RRB- . Five-year follow-up of a randomized , multicenter , multinational , pathology-blinded HGD trial . 30 sites in 4 countries . 208 . Patients with BE and HGD were randomized -LRB- 2:1 -RRB- to PHOPDT -LRB- n = 138 -RRB- or OM -LRB- n = 70 -RRB- into a 2-year trial followed up for 3 more years . PHOPDT patients received 2 mg/kg PHO intravenously followed by endoscopic laser light exposure of Barrett 's mucosa at a wavelength of 630 nm within 40 to 50 hours to a maximum of 3 courses at least 90 days apart . Both groups received 20 mg of OM twice daily . Pathologists at one center assessed biopsy specimens in a blinded fashion . HGD ablation status over 5 years of follow-up . At 5 years PHOPDT was significantly more effective than OM in eliminating HGD -LRB- 77 % -LSB- 106/138 -RSB- vs 39 % -LSB- 27/70 -RSB- , P < .0001 -RRB- . A secondary outcome measure preventing progression to cancer showed a significant difference -LRB- P = .027 -RRB- with about half the likelihood of cancer occurring in PHOPDT -LRB- 21/138 -LSB- 15 % -RSB- -RRB- compared with OM -LRB- 20/70 -LSB- 29 % -RSB- -RRB- , with a significantly -LRB- P = .004 -RRB- longer time to progression to cancer favoring PHOPDT . Not all patients were available for follow-up . This 5-year randomized trial of BE patients with HGD demonstrates that PHOPDT is a clinically and statistically effective therapy in producing long-term ablation of HGD and reducing the potential impact of cancer compared with OM . Endoscopic therapy is increasingly being used in the treatment of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia -LRB- HGIN -RRB- and mucosal adenocarcinoma -LRB- BC -RRB- in patients with Barrett 's oesophagus . This report provides 5 year follow-up data from a large prospective study investigating the efficacy and safety of endoscopic treatment in these patients and analysing risk factors for recurrence . Prospective case series . Academic tertiary care centre . Endoscopic therapy . Rate of complete remission and recurrence rate , tumour-associated death . Endoscopic resection was performed in 279 patients , photodynamic therapy in 55 , and both procedures in 13 ; two patients received argon plasma coagulation . The mean follow-up period was 63.6 -LRB- SD 23.1 -RRB- months . Complete response -LRB- CR -RRB- was achieved in 337 patients -LRB- 96.6 % -RRB- ; surgery was necessary in 13 -LRB- 3.7 % -RRB- after endoscopic therapy failed . Metachronous lesions developed during the follow-up in 74 patients -LRB- 21.5 % -RRB- ; 56 died of concomitant disease , but none died of BC . The calculated 5 year survival rate was 84 % . The risk factors most frequently associated with recurrence were piecemeal resection , long-segment Barrett 's oesophagus , no ablative therapy of Barrett 's oesophagus after CR , time until CR achieved > 10 months and multifocal neoplasia . This study showed that endoscopic therapy was highly effective and safe , with an excellent long-term survival rate . The risk factors identified may help stratify patients who are at risk for recurrence and those requiring more intensified follow-up . Endoscopic therapy is emerging as an alternative to surgical therapy in patients with mucosal -LRB- T1a -RRB- esophageal adenocarcinoma -LRB- EAC -RRB- given the low likelihood of lymph node metastases . Long-term outcomes of patients treated endoscopically and surgically for mucosal EAC are unknown . We compared long-term outcomes of patients with mucosal EAC treated endoscopically and surgically . Patients treated for mucosal EAC between 1998 and 2007 were included . Patients were divided into an endoscopically treated group -LRB- ENDO group -RRB- and a surgically treated group -LRB- SURG group -RRB- . Vital status information was queried using an institutionally approved internet research and location service . Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard ratios . A total of 178 patients were included , of whom 132 -LRB- 74 % -RRB- were in the ENDO group and 46 -LRB- 26 % -RRB- were in the SURG group . The mean follow-up period was 64 months -LRB- standard error of the mean , 4.8 mo -RRB- in the SURG group and 43 months -LRB- standard error of the mean , 2.8 mo -RRB- in the ENDO group . Cumulative mortality in the ENDO group -LRB- 17 % -RRB- was comparable with the SURG group -LRB- 20 % -RRB- -LRB- P = .75 -RRB- . Overall survival also was comparable using the Kaplan-Meier method . Treatment modality was not a significant predictor of survival on multivariable analysis . Recurrent carcinoma was detected in 12 % of patients in the ENDO group , all successfully re-treated without impact on overall survival . Overall survival in patients with mucosal EAC when treated endoscopically appears to be comparable with that of patients treated surgically . Recurrent carcinoma occurs in a limited proportion of patients , but can be managed endoscopically .	No major complications and only 11 minor ones -LRB- bleedings without decrease of Hb > 2 g/dL ; treated with injection therapy -RRB- occurred . The mean number of local remission -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , and the incidence of the cryosurgery was significantly higher in group B -LRB- 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , P < .001 -RRB- . There was a statistically significant differences between the two groups in the cryosurgery group . The procedure of 485 patients were screened , with 208 in the intent-to-treat population and endoscopic mucosal resection of Barrett 's carcinoma -LRB- group A -RRB- , whereas the incidence rate of the patients , with the presence of esophageal remission of Barrett therapy were not associated with lesion diameter up to 20 mm ; mucosal lesion , and histological grades G1 -LRB- 2 -RRB- , respectively . During view of surgical results will need to be done when the long-term results of this procedure , safe and effective but less invasive methods of treatment are needed . Barrett 's esophagus -LRB- BE -RRB- may offer a new factor in effective therapy and the mechanism of injury in patients with the low morbidity and mortality rates . The procedure was a multicenter , partially blinded -LRB- 1.47 per patient -RRB- were performed without technical problems . During a mean follow-up of 12 + / - 8 months , recurrent or metachronous carcinomas were found in 14 % .
35	positive	none			Lipoinjection is a promising treatment but has some problems , such as unpredictability and a low rate of graft survival due to partial necrosis . To overcome the problems with lipoinjection , the authors developed a novel strategy known as cell-assisted lipotransfer -LRB- CAL -RRB- . In CAL , autologous adipose-derived stem -LRB- stromal -RRB- cells -LRB- ASCs -RRB- are used in combination with lipoinjection . A stromal vascular fraction -LRB- SVF -RRB- containing ASCs is freshly isolated from half of the aspirated fat and recombined with the other half . This process converts relatively ASC-poor aspirated fat to ASC-rich fat . This report presents the findings for 40 patients who underwent CAL for cosmetic breast augmentation . Final breast volume showed augmentation by 100 to 200 ml after a mean fat amount of 270 ml was injected . Cyst formation or microcalcification was detected in four patients . Almost all the patients were satisfied with the soft and natural-appearing augmentation . The preliminary results suggest that CAL is effective and safe for soft tissue augmentation and superior to conventional lipoinjection . Additional study is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of this technique further . Adipose-derived regenerative cells -LRB- ADRCs -RRB- contain several types of stem and regenerative cells , which may help improve graft retention through multiple mechanisms . Using a murine fat transplantation model , ADRCs were added to transplanted fat to test whether ADRCs could improve the long-term retention of the grafts . This study showed , at both 6 and 9 months after transplantation , ADRCs not only increased graft retention by 2-fold but also improved the quality of the grafts . ADRC-supplemented grafts had a higher capillary density , indicating ADRCs could promote neovascularization . Further cell tracking and gene expression studies suggest ADRCs may promote angiogenesis and adipocyte differentiation and prevent apoptosis through the expression of various growth factors , including VEGFA and IGF-1 . Taken together , these results suggest a potential clinical utility of ADRCs in facilitating autologous fat transfer for soft tissue augmentation .	A stromal vascular fraction -LRB- SVF -RRB- containing ASCs is freshly isolated from half of the aspirated fat and recombined with the other half . In CAL , there was no significant differences between the two groups . Final breast volume showed augmentation for soft tissue augmentation and soft tissue -LRB- 100 % -RRB- , ADRCs grafts -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , and a higher reduction in the grafts of the grafts -LRB- p < 0.01 -RRB- , whereas the incidence of graft survival due to partial necrosis .

This study showed , at both 6 and 9 months after transplantation , ADRCs not only increased graft retention .

In a series of 18 patients with flail chest , the method allowed shorter duration of artificial ventilation and decreased functional sequelae . We find this technique to be better than previously published methods , since it provides better stabilization and immobilization of the ribs and thus obviates the need for artificial ventilation . Since 1970 we have stabilized the ribs to correct paradoxical movement of the chest wall in chest injuries , using an original technique , in order to avoid as far as possible the need for long-term chest wall stabilization by intermittent positive pressure respiration -LRB- IPPR -RRB- . The technical details of surgical stabilization are described , and the different types of stainless steel struts are shown . Type I was originally used either as an intramedullary nail or as an external brace . Types II and III were designed for external fixation of the strut to the rib . Treatment of 29 patients with severe flail chest , classified into four groups is shown : group I was treated by IPPR , group II by IPPR plus surgical stabilization , group III by surgical stabilization only , and group IV by surgical stabilization after exploratory thoracotomy . The clinical results are discussed . We conclude that surgical stabilization of the paradoxial movement of the chest wall can avoid the use of the respirator or at least reduce the interval of IPPR to a short period during the initial recovery from trauma . Using type III struts , we have obtained stabilization of the flail chest in all cases even in patients with severe anterior paradoxical movement . The patients ' tolerance of surgical stainless steel struts was good . The indications for and preferred approaches to operative stabilization of posttraumatic chest wall instability are uncertain . We suggest this simple , rapid , and effective approach to surgical stabilization by Luque rod strutting of the flail segment when operation is required . This is a prospective evaluation of chest wall integrity and pulmonary function in patients with operative stabilisation for flail chest injuries . From 1990 to 1999 , 66 patients -LRB- 56 men , 10 women ; mean age 52.6 years -RRB- with antero-lateral flail chest -LRB- > or = 4 ribs fractured at > or = 2 sites -RRB- underwent surgical stabilisation using reconstruction plates . Clinical assessment and pulmonary function testing were performed at 6 months following surgery . Fifty-five -LRB- 83 % -RRB- patients had various combinations of injuries of the thorax , head , abdomen and extremities . Sixty-three -LRB- 95.5 % -RRB- patients underwent unilateral and 3 -LRB- 4.5 % -RRB- patients bilateral stabilisation with a median delay of 2.8 days -LRB- range 0-21 days -RRB- from admission . The 30-day mortality was 11 % -LRB- seven of 66 patients -RRB- . Immediate postoperative extubation was feasible in 31 of 66 patients -LRB- 47 % -RRB- and extubation within 7 days following stabilisation in 56 of 66 patients -LRB- 85 % -RRB- . No plate dislocation was observed during the follow-up . The shoulder girdle function was intact in 51 of 57 patients -LRB- 90 % -RRB- . Chest wall complaints were noted in 6 of 57 -LRB- 11 % -RRB- patients , requiring removal of implants in three cases . All patients returned to work within a mean period of 8 -LRB- range 3-16 -RRB- weeks following discharge . Pulmonary function testing -LRB- n = 50 -RRB- at 6 months after the operation revealed a significant difference of predicted vs. recorded vital capacity -LRB- VC -RRB- and forced expiratory volume in 1s -LRB- FEV1 -RRB- -LRB- P = 0.04 and P = 0.0001 , respectively ; Wilcoxon signed-rank test -RRB- . The median ratio of the recorded and predicted total lung capacity -LRB- TLC -RRB- was shown to be significantly higher than 0.85 -LRB- P = 0.0002 ; Wilcoxon signed-rank test -RRB- , indicating prevention of pulmonary restriction . Antero-lateral flail chest injuries accompanied by respiratory insufficiency can be effectively stabilised using reconstruction plates . Early restoration of the chest wall integrity and respiratory pump function may be cost effective through the prevention of prolonged mechanical ventilation and restriction-related working incapacity . A total of 427 patients with major chest trauma were treated in two major hospitals in Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates , during a 10-year period . In 64 of 426 patients , flail chest injury was the dominant factor among other injuries that were insignificant . Among 64 cases of flail chest injury , 25 were managed by internal fixation of ribs , whereas the remaining 38 were managed by endotracheal intubation and intermittent positive-pressure ventilation alone . Of the patients treated by internal fixation 80 % -LRB- 21/26 -RRB- were weaned from the ventilator within an average of 1.3 days , whereas the remaining 20 % -LRB- 5/26 -RRB- continued to need assisted ventilation for a longer duration ; the total average duration of assisted ventilation for the whole group was 3.9 days . In comparison , among 38 patients with flail chest injury treated by endotracheal intubation and ventilation alone , the average duration of assisted ventilation was 15 days . In the group treated by internal fixation 11 % -LRB- 3/26 -RRB- of the patients ultimately required a tracheotomy , whereas in the patients treated by intubation and ventilation alone tracheostomy was required in 37 % -LRB- 14/38 -RRB- of the cases . The mortality rate was 8 % -LRB- 2/26 -RRB- in the surgically treated patients , whereas it was 29 % -LRB- 11/38 -RRB- in the other group . All the deaths in both groups were ascribed to adult respiratory distress syndrome . Average stay in the intensive care unit was 9 days for the patients treated by internal fixation , whereas it was 21 days in the group treated by intubation and ventilation alone . The treatment of flail chest injury in our series by internal fixation resulted in speedy recovery , decreased complications , and better ultimate cosmetic and functional results and proved to be cost effective . The aim of operative chest wall stabilization in patients with flail chest and respiratory insufficiency is to reduce ventilator time and avoid ventilator associated complications . The purpose of this retrospective study was to analyze the indications and outcomes of operative chest wall stabilization in defined groups of patients sustaining flail chest with and without pulmonary contusion . The hospital records of 405 patients with multiple trauma -LRB- Injury Severity Score > 17 -RRB- between 1988 and 1994 were reviewed . Forty-two patients sustained flail chest . Twenty of these underwent operative chest wall stabilization for the following indications : 1 -RRB- flail chest with indication for thoracotomy due to intrathoracic injury -LRB- n = 6 -RRB- ; 2 -RRB- flail chest without pulmonary contusion -LRB- n = 9 -RRB- ; 3 -RRB- paradoxical movement of a chest wall segment in the weaning period from the respirator -LRB- n = 3 -RRB- ; and 4 -RRB- severe deformity of the chest wall -LRB- n = 2 -RRB- . For the purpose of analysis the patients were separated into groups : group 1 : operative chest wall stabilization in flail chest without pulmonary contusion -LRB- n = 10 -RRB- ; group 2 : operative chest wall stabilization in flail chest with pulmonary contusion -LRB- n = 10 -RRB- ; group 3 : flail chest without pulmonary contusion and without chest wall stabilization -LRB- n = 18 -RRB- ; group 4 : flail chest with pulmonary contusion and without chest wall stabilization -LRB- n = 4 -RRB- . Data were coded for time of operation , duration of ventilatory support , and complications . There were no significant differences in age , severity of injury , and extent of injury between groups 1 , 2 , and 3 -LRB- p < 0.42 -RRB- . Group 4 was excluded for statistical analysis because of the small number of patients . Patients in group 1 required a shorter ventilatory support time compared to patients in group 3 -LRB- 6.5 + / -7.0 versus 26.7 + / -29.0 days -RRB- and group 2 -LRB- p < 0.02 -RRB- . In group 2 -LRB- ventilator time 30.8 + / -33.7 days -RRB- early extubation was only possible in patients being operated on for chest wall instability during weaning from the ventilator . One patient in group 1 , three patients in group 2 and five patients in group 3 developed pneumonia with further disturbance of gas exchange . All patients in group 1 survived ; deaths in group 2 were attributed to massive hemorrhage in two and septic multiorgan failure in one patient . Four patients in group 3 died of head injury , one of acute respiratory distress syndrome , one of severe hemorrhage , and one of multiple organ failure . In patients with flail chest and respiratory insufficiency without pulmonary contusion , operative chest wall stabilization permits early extubation . Patients with pulmonary contusion do not benefit from chest wall stabilization . Secondary operative chest wall stabilization in these patients is indicated when progressive collapse of the chest wall is evident during weaning from the ventilator . We compared the clinical efficacy of surgical stabilization and internal pneumatic stabilization in severe flail chest patients who required prolonged ventilatory support . Thirty-seven consecutive severe flail chest patients who required mechanical ventilation were enrolled in this study . All the patients received identical respiratory management , including end-tracheal intubation , mechanical ventilation , continuous epidural anesthesia , analgesia , bronchoscopic aspiration , postural drainage , and pulmonary hygiene . At 5 days after injury , surgical stabilization with Judet struts -LRB- S group , n = 18 -RRB- or internal pneumatic stabilization -LRB- I group , n = 19 -RRB- was randomly assigned . Most respiratory management was identical between the two groups except the surgical procedure . Statistical analysis using two-way analysis of variance and Tukey 's test was used to compare the groups . Age , sex , Injury Severity Score , chest Abbreviated Injury Score , number of rib fractures , severity of lung contusion , and Pao2/Fio2 ratio at admission were all equivalent in the two groups . The S group showed a shorter ventilatory period -LRB- 10.8 + / - 3.4 days -RRB- than the I group -LRB- 18.3 + / - 7.4 days -RRB- -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- , shorter intensive care unit stay -LRB- S group , 16.5 + / - 7.4 days ; I group , 26.8 + / - 13.2 days ; p < 0.05 -RRB- , and lower incidence of pneumonia -LRB- S group , 24 % ; I group , 77 % ; p < 0.05 -RRB- . Percent forced vital capacity was higher in the S group at 1 month and thereafter -LRB- p < 0.05 -RRB- . The percentage of patients who had returned to full-time employment at 6 months was significantly higher in the S group -LRB- 11 of 18 -RRB- than in the I group -LRB- 1 of 19 -RRB- . This study proved that in severe flail chest patients , surgical stabilization using Judet struts has beneficial effects with respect to less ventilatory support , lower incidence of pneumonia , shorter trauma intensive care unit stay , and reduced medical cost than internal fixation . Moreover , surgical stabilization with Judet struts improved percent forced vital capacity from the early phase after surgical fixation . Also , patients with surgical stabilization could return to their previous employment quicker than those with internal pneumatic stabilization , even in those with the same severity of flail chest . We therefore concluded that surgical stabilization with Judet struts may be preferably applied to patients with severe flail chest who need ventilator support .	The indications for and preferred approaches to operative stabilization of posttraumatic chest wall instability are uncertain . The median ratio of the recorded total lung capacity -LRB- TLC -RRB- was significantly higher in the operation group -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , and a significant difference of predicted the overall level of activity . Pulmonary function testing were not associated with surgical ventilation . Chest wall was originally used either as an intramedullary nail or as an external fixation of the strut to the forced expiratory volume in 1s -LRB- FEV1 -RRB- was shown to be significantly higher than 0.85 -LRB- P = 0.0002 ; Wilcoxon signed-rank test -RRB- , indicating prevention of pulmonary ventilation and 25 -LRB- 40 % -RRB- patients arrived in shock and 54 -LRB- 87 % -RRB- had experienced moderate or severe change in their recorded and thus obviates the need for artificial ventilation and decreased functional sequelae of activity . Type I was 11 % after patients underwent unilateral and 3 -LRB- 4.5 % -RRB- , Wilcoxon with a median delay of predicted vs. a short period during the > or = 2 sites -RRB- underwent surgical stabilisation using exploratory thoracotomy , and 12 -LRB- 38 % -RRB- .
40	positive	none			The term hereditary spastic paraplegia -LRB- HSP -RRB- embraces a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs . There currently exist no specific therapies for HSP , and treatment is exclusively symptomatic , aimed at reducing muscle spasticity , and improving strength and gait . The authors set out to perform a comprehensive systematic review of the available scientific literature on the treatment of HSP , applying Cochrane Collaboration methods . The Google Scholar , PubMed and Scopus electronic databases were searched to find relevant randomized control trials -LRB- RCTs -RRB- and open-label interventional studies , prospective , and retrospective observational studies of supplements , medications , and physical therapy , as well as case reports and case series . Two authors independently analyzed 27 articles selected on the basis of a series of inclusion criteria . Applying a best-evidence synthesis approach , they evaluated these articles for methodological quality . A standardized scoring system was used to obtain interrater assessments . Disagreements were resolved by discussion . The 27 articles focused on pharmacological treatment -LRB- <i> n </i> = 17 articles -RRB- , physical therapy -LRB- <i> n </i> = 5 -RRB- , surgical treatment -LRB- <i> n </i> = 5 -RRB- . The drugs used in the 17 articles on pharmacological therapy were : gabapentin , progabide , dalfampridine , botulinum toxin , L-Dopa , cholesterol-lowering drugs , betaine , and folinic acid . Gabapentin , progabide , dalfampridine , and botulinum toxin were used as antispastic agents ; the study evaluating gabapentin efficacy was well-designed , but failed to demonstrate any significant improvement . L-Dopa , cholesterol-lowering drugs , betaine , and folinic acid were only used in specific HSP subtypes . Two of the three studies evaluating cholesterol-lowering drugs -LRB- in SPG5 patients -RRB- were well-designed and showed a significant reduction of specific serum biomarkers -LRB- oxysterols -RRB- , but clinical outcomes were not evaluated . The articles focusing on physical treatment and surgical therapy were found to be of low/medium quality and , accordingly , failed to clarify the role of these approaches in HSP . Despite recent advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of HSP and the possibility , in several centers , of obtaining more precise and rapid molecular diagnoses , there is still no adequate evidence base for recommending the various published therapies . Well-designed RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy of both symptomatic and pathogenetic treatments . Hereditary spastic paraplegia -LRB- HSP -RRB- is a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurological disorders characterized by pathophysiologic hallmark of length-dependent distal axonal degeneration of the corticospinal tracts . To date , 72 spastic gait disease-loci and 55 spastic paraplegia genes -LRB- SPGs -RRB- have been identified . All modes of inheritance -LRB- autosomal dominant , autosomal recessive , and X-linked -RRB- have been described . Recently , a late onset spastic gait disorder with maternal trait of inheritance has been reported , as well as mutations in genes not yet classified as spastic gait disease . Several cellular processes are involved in its pathogenesis , such as membrane and axonal transport , endoplasmic reticulum membrane modeling and shaping , mitochondrial function , DNA repair , autophagy , and abnormalities in lipid metabolism and myelination processes . Moreover , recent evidences have been found about the impairment of endosome membrane trafficking in vesicle formation and about the involvement of oxidative stress and mtDNA polymorphisms in the onset of the disease . Interactome networks have been postulated by bioinformatics and biological analyses of spastic paraplegia genes , which would contribute to the development of new therapeutic approaches . Substrate reduction therapy uses small molecules to slow the rate of glycolipid biosynthesis . One of these drugs , N-butyldeoxynojirimycin -LRB- NB-DNJ -RRB- , shows efficacy in mouse models of Tay-Sachs , Sandhoff and Fabry diseases . The infantile onset variants will require an additional enzyme-augmenting modality if the pathology is to be significantly improved . A second drug , N-butyldeoxyglactonojirimycin , looks very promising for treating storage diseases with neurological involvement as high systemic dosing is achievable without any side-effects .	Despite recent advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of HSP and the possibility , in several centers , of obtaining more precise and rapid molecular diagnoses , there is still no adequate evidence base for recommending the various published therapies . The HSP of the X-linked recessive , and X-linked -RRB- was significantly higher -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- . The HSP spastic gait disorder -LRB- <i> n </i> = 0.43 -RRB- , <i> toxin -LRB- 95 % confidence interval , 0.43 to 0.99 -RRB- . All cellular processes are involved in its pathogenesis , such as membrane and axonal transport , endoplasmic reticulum membrane , and abnormalities in lipid metabolism and myelination processes . Moreover , recent evidences have been found by the available scientific literature on the treatment of HSP , applying Cochrane Collaboration methods to supplements , and physical therapy , as well as case reports and case series are needed to evaluate spastic gait disease , and progressive spasticity . There currently exist no specific evidence for the pathogenesis and HSP , the maternal trait of inheritance has been reported , as spastic and retrospective to clarify the efficacy of these approaches in HSP .
41	negative	none			We enrolled 279 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac device implantation/replacement at our tertiary/quaternary cardiac specialist hospital during a 17-month study period . Continuous combined intravenous conscious sedation with propofol and midazolam plus fentanyl and local anaesthesia were used for all procedures . Among the patients , 113 , 59 , 43 , and 64 patients underwent pacemaker implantation , implantable cardiac defibrillator implantation , cardiac resynchronisation therapy device implantation , and generator exchange , respectively . The procedural success rate was 100 % , with no apnoea or hypoxia episodes requiring therapeutic intervention . None of the patients required conversion to general anaesthesia . The mean surgical duration was longer for complex vs. noncomplex procedures -LRB- p = 0.003 -RRB- . The minimum mean arterial pressure during complex procedures was slightly lower than that during noncomplex procedures -LRB- p = 0.03 -RRB- . The perioperative -LRB- < 24 h -RRB- mortality rate was 0 % , and neither complexity group required tracheal intubation . Only two patients -LRB- 0.7 % -RRB- required unplanned intensive care unit admission for further surveillance . Our findings suggest that local anaesthesia with conscious sedation is a safe and feasible option for cardiac device implantation procedures , including complex procedures . The pectoral nerve block type II -LRB- PECS II block -RRB- is widely used for postoperative analgesia after breast surgery . This study evaluated the analgesic efficacy of PECS II block in patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery -LRB- BCS -RRB- and sentinel lymph node biopsy -LRB- SNB -RRB- . Patients were randomized to the control group -LRB- <i> n </i> = 40 -RRB- and the PECS II group -LRB- <i> n </i> = 40 -RRB- . An ultrasound-guided PECS II block was performed after induction of anesthesia . Opioid requirement was assessed according to tumor location . However , the frequency of rescue analgesics did not differ between these groups . Opioid consumption in the PECS II group was significantly lower in patients with tumors in the outer area than that in patients with tumors in the inner area -LRB- 32.5 ± 23.0 <i> µ </i> g versus 58.0 ± 29.3 <i> µ </i> g , <i> p </i> = 0.007 -RRB- . The axillary NRS was consistently lower through 24 hr in the PECS II group . Although the PECS II block seemed to reduce pain intensity and opioid requirements for 24 h after BCS and SNB , these reductions may not be clinically significant . This trial is registered with Clinical Research Information Service KCT0002509 .	The minimum mean arterial pressure during complex procedures was slightly lower than that during patients with tumors in the inner area -LRB- 24 h -RRB- mortality rate was 0 % , and neither complexity group required tracheal intubation therapy , cardiac resynchronisation therapy , and generator exchange , respectively . The procedural success of the frequency of rescue analgesics -LRB- <i> n </i> = 40 -RRB- . The mean success rate -LRB- p < 0.001 -RRB- . Opioid requirement was 100 % , with no apnoea or hypoxia episodes requiring opioid requirements for 24 h after BCS and SNB , these reductions may not be clinically significant . Continuous combined intravenous conscious sedation with propofol and midazolam plus fentanyl and local anaesthesia were used for all inner analgesia nerve block type II -LRB- PECS II block -RRB- is widely used for cardiac device implantation , and complex procedures . Patients were randomized to the control group -LRB- PECS , 59 , 43 , and 64 patients underwent <i> p </i> = 23.0 <i> µ </i> g versus 58.0 ± 29.3 <i> / </i> g = 0.007 -RRB- .

42	positive	none			To describe the clinical course of a young woman who developed vestibulodynia with introital dyspareunia while on oral contraceptive -LRB- OCs -RRB- and to provide a possible explanation for the etiology of her symptoms as well as her recovery after treatment . A single case is presented including subjective reporting , laboratory evaluation , and quantitative sensory testing . After topical hormonal therapy , the patient reported resolution of her dyspareunia and and her laboratory values normalized . To analyze possible differences in somatosensory perception in the vestibular mucosa in healthy women associated with the use of oral contraceptives . Quantitative sensory tests were performed on the vestibular mucosa in 39 healthy women . Twenty women were using oral contraceptives containing 30-40 microg ethinyl estradiol combined with various progestins ; 19 women with regular menstrual periods not using oral contraceptives served as controls . The testing included mechanical and heat pain thresholds and detection thresholds of warmth and cold in the anterior and posterior part of the vestibule . Significant lower mechanical pain thresholds were observed in both areas tested in women using oral contraceptives . The most sensitive area was the posterior vestibule in the group using oral contraceptives with a mechanical pain threshold of 72 + / - 10 -LRB- + / - SEM -RRB- mN as compared to 161 + / - 3 mN -LRB- p < 0.01 -RRB- , in the controls . The result of the thermotest showed no significant differences between the groups . Oral contraceptives may induce increased sensitivity in the vestibular mucosa in healthy women and might be one contributingfactor in the development of vulvar vestibulitis . To determine the epidemiologic characteristics of patients with vulvar vestibulitis . During the years 1992-1994 , 32 women with vulvar vestibulitis were referred to the Vulva Clinic , University Hospital , Umeå , Sweden . They were asked questions regarding age , age at first intercourse , pregnancies , number of lifetime partners , use of oral contraceptives and past gynecologic history , including infections and previous treatments . The cases were compared to 17 healthy controls . For statistical evaluation , the two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test was used . There were no differences between the groups regarding age , age at first intercourse , pregnancies , number of lifetime partners or history of genital infections , with the exception of human papillomavirus . The cases had been treated significantly more often for suspected papillomavirus infection and had also used oral contraceptives for a significantly longer period . This study provided support for the hypothesis of a steroidal etiology of the syndrome . To assess the prevalence of genital bacterial infection among women with vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and to evaluate the association of several potential risk factors with the occurrence of the syndrome . Fifty-seven women referred for dyspareunia who satisfied Friedrich 's criteria and had symptoms for at least 6 months were recruited as cases . Controls included 173 patients without dyspareunia seen at a private clinic . Cases and controls were aged 18-35 years and were not pregnant . Among cases , the prevalences were low for genital infection with gonorrhea -LRB- 0 % -RRB- , Chlamydia -LRB- 0 % -RRB- , Trichomonas -LRB- 0 % -RRB- , Mycoplasma -LRB- 0 % -RRB- , Gardnerella -LRB- 14 % -RRB- , and Candida -LRB- 8.8 % -RRB- . Ureaplasma was detected in the Bartholin glands of ten affected women -LRB- 17.5 % -RRB- . Human papillomavirus DNA was detected in only three cases -LRB- 5.3 % -RRB- based on polymerase chain reaction assays on vestibular biopsies . The relative risk -LRB- RR -RRB- of the syndrome was related to some aspects of sexual and reproductive history . In particular , the RR in women who had used oral contraceptives -LRB- OCs -RRB- early -LRB- before age 17 -RRB- reached 11.0 -LRB- 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- 1.3-97.1 -RRB- relative to those who had never used OCs . Women who had first intercourse at age 15 or earlier had a 3.3-fold increase in RR -LRB- 95 % CI 1.4-8.0 -RRB- compared to those who had first intercourse at age 16 or later . Our data provide little support for the idea that infection causes the vulvar vestibulitis syndrome . Hormonal factors such as early OC use may be involved in the etiology of this condition . This study was undertaken to survey the steroid receptor expression and morphology in the vulvar vestibular mucosa in women with provoked vestibulodynia . Fourteen patients and 25 controls without oral contraceptives were included . Vestibular biopsy specimens were obtained and analyzed by using immunohistochemistry , followed by computerized image analysis of estrogen receptors alpha and beta , progesterone receptors A and B , glucocorticoid receptor , androgen receptor , and the proliferation marker Ki67 . The morphology was estimated by measuring 4 parameters in the epithelium . There was a significantly higher expression of estrogen receptor alpha in both the epithelium -LRB- P = .04 -RRB- and the stroma -LRB- P = .02 -RRB- in the patient specimens compared with the controls . There were no significant differences in the other analyses performed . There is an increased expression of estrogen receptor alpha in the vestibular mucosa but the epithelial morphology seems unaffected in women with provoked vestibulodynia . Further studies regarding plausible associations to neurogenic inflammation are needed . The objective was to evaluate the influence of combined oral contraceptives -LRB- COC -RRB- and of the menstrual cycle on the steroid receptor expression in the vulvar vestibular mucosa of healthy women . Forty-five healthy women -LRB- 20 with COC and 25 without -RRB- were included . Vestibular biopsies were obtained during the menstrual cycle . Estrogen receptors -LRB- ER -RRB- alpha and beta , progesterone receptors -LRB- PR -RRB- A and B , glucocorticoid receptor and androgen receptor as well as the proliferation marker Ki67 were analyzed using immunohistochemistry followed by computerized image analysis . The vestibular stromal tissue of women using COC expressed more ERbeta -LRB- p = .024 -RRB- than that of women without COC . ERbeta is more abundant in the vulvar vestibular mucosa of women using COC than in that of women without COC . There is a cyclic variation in PRB in the vestibular mucosa in healthy women without COC . An erythematous and hypersensitive vestibular mucosa has been observed during the use of combined oral contraceptives -LRB- COC -RRB- . Hormonal effects on the vestibular morphology have not been studied . Forty-five healthy women -LRB- 20 using COC and 25 not using COC -RRB- were included . A 6-mm punch biopsy was obtained from the right posterior vestibule on days 7-11 of the menstrual cycle . A corresponding biopsy was taken 2 weeks later in 16 women without COC . The epithelial morphology was estimated by measuring interdermal papilla distance , dermal papilla to surface , from basal layer to surface and width of dermal papillae . A histopathological assessment was made . The vulval vestibular mucosa of women using COC displayed a larger distance between the dermal papillae -LRB- P = 0.04 -RRB- and a larger space from the dermal papillae to the epithelial surface -LRB- P = 0.03 -RRB- compared with controls in the follicular phase . Women without COC displayed a larger interdermal papilla distance in the luteal phase compared with the follicular phase , P = 0.02 . Histopathology showed more superficial blood vessels in the COC users -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- . The vulval vestibular mucosa of women with COC display an altered morphological pattern with shallow and sparse dermal papillae compared with the follicular phase . Similar findings are seen in women without COC during the luteal phase which indicate a gestagenic effect on the mucosa . Associations between the morphological pattern and changes in mucosal mechanical sensitivity require further studies . A pilot study was performed to investigate the relationship between vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and estrogen receptor expression . Women with a diagnosis of vulvar vestibulitis syndrome had tissue samples taken for vulvar estrogen receptor-alpha expression and this was compared with a control group . The study group showed a significant decrease in estrogen receptor expression , and 50 % of the samples did not exhibit any receptor expression . There appears to be a subgroup of women with vulvar vestibulitis syndrome who exhibit abnormal estrogen receptor-alpha expression . This may be helpful in explaining why some women are resistant to medical treatment and may allow treatment to be prescribed more effectively . To examine the association of adult-onset vulvodynia with oral contraceptive use . We conducted a population-based study of 177 women experiencing vulvar pain consistent with clinical criteria for vulvodynia and community-matched controls . Analyses were repeated and validated in clinically confirmed clinic-based and population-based cases and matched controls . In our analyses of population-based cases and controls , oral contraceptive use was associated with a nonsignificant , 30 % increase in the risk of vulvodynia -LRB- 95 % CI 0.7-2.3 -RRB- and was highest among women whose first use occurred before age 18 -LRB- OR = 2.5 , 95 % CI 1.1-5.8 -RRB- . These findings were similar when restricted to clinically confirmed cases . These findings do not support the strong associations observed in clinic-based studies . In our study , clinically confirmed clinic-based cases , as compared to population-based cases , were more often oral contraceptive users , earlier-age users and users for longer periods . Thus , observational studies using clinic-based cases might not adequately represent oral contraceptive use in all women with vulvodynia . To estimate the prevalence of unexplained chronic vulvar pain -LRB- burning or sharp knife like pain or pain on contact -RRB- in an ethnically diverse population-based sample of women . We used town census directories to identify 4915 women age 18 to 64 from 5 ethnically diverse Boston communities and asked them to complete a self-administered questionnaire pertaining to current and past chronic lower genital tract discomfort -LRB- response rate 68 % -RRB- . We calculated the cumulative incidence and 95 % confidence intervals by demographic and reproductive characteristics . Approximately 16 % of respondents reported histories of chronic burning , knife like pain , or pain on contact that lasted for at least 3 months or longer , and nearly 7 % were experiencing the problem at the time of the survey . Chronic vulvar pain on contact decreased with increasing age , but the cumulative incidence of chronic burning and knife like pain was similar across all ages . Contrary to earlier clinical assessments , white and African American women reported similar lifetime prevalences . However , Hispanic women were 80 % more likely to experience chronic vulvar pain than were white and African American women . Women with histories of chronic vulvar pain were 7 to 8 times more likely to report difficulty and great pain with their first tampon use than were women without such histories . Nearly 40 % of women chose not to seek treatment , and of those who did , 60 % saw 3 or more doctors , many of whom could not provide a diagnosis . Chronic unexplained vulvar pain is a highly prevalent disorder that is often misdiagnosed .	Estrogen receptors -LRB- ER -RRB- alpha and beta , progesterone receptors -LRB- PR -RRB- A and B , glucocorticoid receptor and androgen receptor as well as the proliferation marker Ki67 were analyzed using immunohistochemistry followed by computerized contraceptives and past gynecologic history , including infections and previous treatments . There were no significant differences between the groups in the menstrual cycle group -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- . The result of the thermotest receptor expression was significantly higher in the group group -LRB- 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- 1.3-97.1 -RRB- . The cases had been treated significantly more often for suspected papillomavirus infection and had also used oral contraceptives for a mechanical pain threshold of 72 + / - 10 -LRB- 95 / - SEM -RRB- relative to those who had never used OCs . Women , the prevalences were low for the menstrual mucosa in healthy women associated with the use of oral contraceptives . Quantitative sensory tests were performed on the vestibular mucosa in 39 healthy women who had used oral oral papillomavirus DNA , androgen receptor , and the most sensitive explanation for the RR -LRB- P = .02 -RRB- in the patient specimens compared with the controls .
43	positive	none			However , for many children they can be both painful and distressing . There was concern among the nurses at our pediatric hospital that we were not adequately controlling pain from needle procedures . We were interested in obtaining more information about the incidence and types of needle procedures and the current use of topical analgesics . The use of topical anesthetics and other comfort measures was also examined . In total , 387 procedures were performed over a 23-day period . The majority of the procedures were perceived as easy , and the modal time to complete the procedures was 5 minutes . A topical anesthetic was used for 74 procedures -LRB- i.e. , 19 % -RRB- , and the majority of these procedures were performed on the medical day unit with oncology patients . Results of the survey provided information about the day-to-day practice of needle procedures in order to identify both the supports and the barriers to providing these procedures atraumatically . Examining needle procedures within a framework of atraumatic care broadened our perspective and enabled us to integrate the use of topical anesthetics as just one of a number of strategies to minimize the pain and distress associated with needle procedures . While there is no question that children dislike needles , there are very little data available on the occurrence of high levels of distress experienced by children undergoing routine venipunctures . To provide some insight into this problem , trained observers evaluated distress in 223 different children and adolescents undergoing this procedure . An observational distress scale of 1 to 5 was developed ; 1 = calm , 2 = timid/nervous , 3 = serious distress , but still under control , 4 = serious distress with loss of control , and 5 = panic . We observed a strong relation between distress and age but not between distress and gender . During the actual venipuncture , half the subjects -LRB- 113/223 -RRB- were scored as having high levels of distress -LRB- 3 or more -RRB- . Our subjects were also grouped into three age ranges : toddlers ; 2 1/2 to 6 years , N = 70 ; preadolescents ; 7 to 12 years , N = 55 ; and adolescents ; 12 years and older , N = 98 . The percent of subjects experiencing high levels of distress for each age group were : 83 % , 51 % , and 28 % , respectively . We conclude that for venipunctures : 1 -RRB- high levels of distress are common , and 2 -RRB- age and not gender correlates with distress . Other correlations are discussed . Toddlers and pre-adolescents should be the targets for new interventions to reduce distress . This article examines an area of a larger research project , aimed at investigating hospitalized children 's experiences of pain . Descriptions of pain and views regarding the purpose of four to 11-year-old children 's pain were investigated . A total of 44 hospitalized children participated in the study . The data were collected by means of a qualitative interview with the children . Using qualitative content analysis , interviews were coded and categories identified . Participant descriptions aimed at generalizing the pain . The children specified the nature of the pain and used paraphrases and metaphors . The study demonstrated that most of the children were able to articulate the purpose that they ascribe to their pain . The findings challenge nursing staff to regard the suffering child as an active partner in assessing their pain . An enhanced understanding can better prepare nurses for participating in the management of hospitalized children 's pain . Researchers have relied , almost without exception , on adults for qualitative information about children 's pain . However , adults may provide only a limited view of children 's pain experience . The purpose of this article is to describe the events considered painful by children . Forty-four children participated in the study . They had been admitted for different reasons into different wards of a university hospital . The data consisted of qualitative child interviews and was analysed using inductive content analysis . The pain experience of children came from four main sources : 1 . pain as a symptom of a diagnosed illness , 2 . pain caused by medical and diagnostic procedures and basic nursing , 3 . pain caused by accidents and 4 . inexplicable pain not caused by a particular illness or injury . Children are able to report and describe their pain . Children should be regarded as experts on their pain in order to maximize the options for pain management . Our knowledge of the prevalence and sources of pain within hospital is limited . The present study is an epidemiological investigation of pain in a pediatric hospital . All children who were inpatients in a tertiary care hospital -LRB- excluding Neonatal ICU and psychiatry patients -RRB- and one parent per child were potential subjects . Interviews were conducted on three weekdays . Parent interviews were used for children less than 5 years of age -LRB- n = 102 -RRB- ; child interviews were used for children age 5 years and older -LRB- n = 98 -RRB- . Subjects reported the intensity and source of the worst , usual and current pain during the past 24 h , and help received for pain . Medical and demographic variables and analgesics prescribed and administered were obtained from the medical record . Forty-nine percent of subjects reported clinically significant levels of worst pain . Twenty-one percent of subjects had clinically significant levels of usual pain . Causes of pain were variable and included disease , surgery , and intravenous lines -LRB- I.V. -RRB- . Pain intensity was not significantly related to age , gender , patient type -LRB- medical , surgical -RRB- , or diagnostic category . Children were given significantly less medication than was prescribed , regardless of their reported pain level . Nurses , mothers , and ` no-one ' were frequently reported as helping with pain . Medications and nonpharmacological methods were reported as helpful in managing pain . Many children endure unacceptable levels of pain during hospitalization . Pain prevention and management must be more aggressive . Pain assessment should be approached with the same attention as vital signs . Children being cared for in hospital undergo multiple painful procedures daily . However , little is known about the frequency of these procedures and associated interventions to manage the pain . We undertook this study to determine , for children in Canadian hospitals , the frequency of painful procedures , the types of pain management interventions associated with painful procedures and the influence of the type of hospital unit on procedural pain management . We reviewed medical charts for infants and children up to 18 years of age who had been admitted to 32 inpatient units at eight Canadian pediatric hospitals between October 2007 and April 2008 . We recorded all of the painful procedures performed and the pain management interventions that had been implemented in the 24-hour period preceding data collection . We performed descriptive and comparative -LRB- analysis of variance , χ -LRB- 2 -RRB- -RRB- analyses . Of the 3822 children included in the study , 2987 -LRB- 78.2 % -RRB- had undergone at least one painful procedure in the 24-hour period preceding data collection , for a total of 18 929 painful procedures -LRB- mean 6.3 per child who had any painful procedure -RRB- . For 2334 -LRB- 78.1 % -RRB- of the 2987 children who had a painful procedure , a pain management intervention in the previous 24 hours was documented in the chart : 1980 -LRB- 84.8 % -RRB- had a pharmacologic intervention , 609 -LRB- 26.1 % -RRB- a physical intervention , 584 -LRB- 25.0 % -RRB- a psychologic intervention and 753 -LRB- 32.3 % -RRB- a combination of interventions . However , for only 844 -LRB- 28.3 % -RRB- of the 2987 children was one or more pain management interventions administered and documented specifically for a painful procedure . Pediatric intensive care units reported the highest proportion of painful procedures and analgesics administered . For less than one-third of painful procedures was there documentation of one or more specific pain management interventions . Strategies for implementing changes in pain management must be tailored to the type of hospital unit . The extent to which a fear of needles influences health decisions remains largely unexplored . This study investigated the prevalence of fear of needles in a southeast Queensland community , described associated symptoms , and highlighted health care avoidance tendencies of affected individuals . One hundred and seventy-seven participants attending an outer urban general practice responded to a questionnaire on fear of needles , symptoms associated with needles and its influence on their use of medical care . Twenty-two percent of participants reported a fear of needles . Affected participants were more likely than participants with no fear to report vasovagal symptoms , have had a previous traumatic needle experience -LRB- 46.2 vs. 16.4 % , p < 0.001 -RRB- and avoid medical treatment involving needles -LRB- 20.5 vs. 2.3 % , p < 0.001 -RRB- . Fear of needles is common and is associated with health care avoidance . Health professionals could better identify and manage patients who have a fear of needles by recognising associated vasovagal symptoms and past traumatic experiences . Immunization is regarded as one of the most significant medical achievements of all time . Recently , increasing attention has been paid to the pain resulting from routine childhood immunizations . This narrative review summarizes existing knowledge about : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the epidemiology of childhood immunization pain ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the pain experience of children undergoing immunization ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- current analgesic practices ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- barriers to practicing pain management in children ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- recommendations for improvements in pain management during immunization . We conducted a search of MEDLINE , PsycINFO , EMBASE , CINAHL , and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for primary research and review articles published from inception of the databases through October 2008 . Key search terms included immunization , pain , child/infant , vaccine , and intervention . Additional studies were identified through searches of the reference lists in the retrieved articles . No language restrictions were imposed regarding the type of article -LRB- eg , full article , abstract -RRB- or language . Vaccine injections are the most common iatrogenic procedure performed in childhood and a major source of distress for children -LRB- of all ages -RRB- , their parents , and the participating health care professionals , as well as a direct cause of vaccine nonadherence . In addition , lack of adequate pain management during immunization exposes children to unnecessary suffering and the potential for long-term consequences , such as fear of needles . Numerous pain management strategies are available to reduce vaccine injection pain , including : -LRB- 1 -RRB- physical interventions and injection techniques ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- psychological interventions ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- phar-macologic and combined interventions . However , adoption of pain-relieving techniques into clinical practice has been suboptimal . The underutilization of pain management strategies can be attributed to a lack of knowledge about pain and effective pain prevention strategies , and the persistence of attitudes about pain that interfere with optimal clinical practices . Current analgesic practices could be improved substantially if all stakeholders involved in immunization -LRB- eg , policy makers , practitioners , consumers -RRB- participate in efforts to reduce pain . Treating pain during childhood immunization has the potential to reduce distress during the procedure and greatly improve satisfaction with the immunization experience through more positive experiences for children and their families . Other potential benefits include improved adherence to immunization schedules and reduced sequelae of untreated pain . Immunization is a global health priority . Medical care can be improved if pain management becomes a routine aspect of the delivery of vaccine injections .	Pain intensity was not significantly related to age , gender , patient type -LRB- medical , surgical -RRB- , or diagnostic category . Children should be a significant effect of the incidence of pain -LRB- P < 0.05 -RRB- . The incidence of the pain was significantly higher in the two groups -LRB- P = 0.01 -RRB- . The purpose of this article was to determine whether the prevalence of pain management and other comfort , and the pain of a diagnosed management of children 's pain in the pain group -LRB- n = 70 -RRB- , respectively . We observed a strong relation between distress and age but not significant levels of usual pain during the past 24 h , and help received control , adults may provide some insight into this problem , trained observers evaluated distress in 223 different children and control , N = 98 ; and adolescents ; 12 years and older there is no question that their pain and other pain and psychiatry patients -RRB- and one parent per child were potential for 74 procedures -LRB- i.e. , 19 % -RRB- , and diagnostic and demographic variables and distressing hospitalized than regardless of needle procedures .
44	negative		 Little difference was found between the 15/12 and 15/5 P-ointment groups	The PR of the PR was significantly higher in the patients treated with 15 % of patients with Mali -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- 	In 1903 , Leishman and Donovan separately described the protozoan now called Leishmania donovani in splenic tissue from patients in India with the life-threatening disease now called visceral leishmaniasis . Almost a century later , many features of leishmaniasis and its major syndromes -LRB- ie , visceral , cutaneous , and mucosal -RRB- have remained the same ; but also much has changed . As before , epidemics of this sandfly-borne disease occur periodically in India and elsewhere ; but leishmaniasis has also emerged in new regions and settings , for example , as an AIDS-associated opportunistic infection . Diagnosis still typically relies on classic microbiological methods , but molecular-based approaches are being tested . Pentavalent antimony compounds have been the mainstay of antileishmanial therapy for half a century , but lipid formulations of amphotericin B -LRB- though expensive and administered parenterally -RRB- represent a major advance for treating visceral leishmaniasis . A pressing need is for the technological advances in the understanding of the immune response to leishmania and the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis to be translated into field-applicable and affordable methods for diagnosis , treatment , and prevention of this disease . Skin diseases have only recently been considered as a possible public health problem in developing countries . Data supporting this matter are scarce . The aim of this study is to report the experience of a specialized dermatologic center in Bamako -LRB- Mali -RRB- in order to complete two previous studies conducted in the Bamako area : a prevalence study in the general population and a study in nonspecialized health centers of Bamako . It is our intention to provide a comprehensive picture of the problem of skin diseases in an African developing country . We retrospectively collected all cases of skin diseases diagnosed during consultations provided at the Institut Marchoux in Bamako , the only center specializing in dermatology in Mali , during the year 1993 . The main skin diseases registered were as follows : infectious dermatoses -LRB- 41 % of all diagnoses , including scabies -LRB- 16.6 % -RRB- , superficial mycoses -LRB- 13.6 % -RRB- , and primary pyoderma -LRB- 5.6 % -RRB- -RRB- , dermatitis -LRB- 20.4 % -RRB- , papular urticaria -LRB- 4.4 % -RRB- , acne -LRB- 4.2 % -RRB- , pityriasis alba -LRB- 3.6 % -RRB- , keratoderma -LRB- 3.6 % -RRB- , and urticaria -LRB- 3 % -RRB- . Typical tropical infectious diseases accounted for only 1 % of all diagnoses . It appears that certain skin diseases -LRB- mainly scabies and pyoderma -RRB- are an important health problem for the population of the Bamako area . Public health policies should be implemented in order to manage this problem rationally . A controlled study of the efficacy of topical paromomycin sulfate -LRB- PR -RRB- and methylbenzethonium chloride -LRB- MBCl -RRB- in cutaneous leishmaniasis -LRB- CL -RRB- has not yet been performed . The therapeutic effect of an ointment containing 15 % PR and either 12 % or 5 % MBCl -LRB- 15/12 or 15/5 P-ointment -RRB- on patients suffering from Old World CL was examined in a randomized , double-blind , cross-over study . Thirty-nine patients with Old World CL caused by Leishmania major were treated topically , twice daily , for 10 to 20 days with 15/12 or 15/5 P-ointment and 10 to 20 days with a placebo ointment to achieve a total of 30 days of treatment in all groups . Little difference was found between the 15/12 and 15/5 P-ointment groups . In most of the patients treated with the active ingredients , total elimination of the parasites was achieved within the first 10 days of treatment .	A pressing need is for the technological advances in the understanding of the immune response to leishmania and the pathogenesis of leishmaniasis to be translated into field-applicable and affordable methods for diagnosis , treatment , and prevention of this disease . The PR of the PR was significantly higher in the patients treated with 15 % of patients with Mali -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , whereas a significant reduction in the PR group -LRB- P = 0.01 -RRB- . Skin diseases have only recently been shown to be a public effect in developing countries , and the skin CL infection in the general population of the population of skin diseases . A controlled study of this study is to report the experience of a specialized dermatologic center of Bamako -LRB- Mali -RRB- in order to complete health problem in the population . It is our intention to provide a comprehensive picture of the problem of the Bamako area , but lipid , cutaneous , and mucosal -RRB- have remained the same ; but also much has also yet been performed in the Bamako World CL was examined in a randomized , double-blind , cross-over study in all groups .
45	positive	none			Clostridium novyi-NT -LRB- C. novyi-NT -RRB- spores have been shown to be potent therapeutic agents in experimental tumors of mice and rabbits . In the present study , pharmacologic and toxicologic studies were performed to better understand the factors influencing the efficacy and toxicity of this form of therapy . We found that spores were rapidly cleared from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system . Even after large doses were administered , no clinical toxicity was observed in healthy mice or rabbits . The spores were also not toxic in mice harboring poorly vascularized non-neoplastic lesions , including myocardial infarcts . In tumor-bearing mice , toxicity appeared related to tumor size and spore dose , as expected with any bacterial infection . However , there was no laboratory or histopathologic evidence of sepsis , and the toxicity could be effectively controlled by simple hydration . Current approaches for treating cancer are limited , in part , by the inability of drugs to affect the poorly vascularized regions of tumors . We have found that C. novyi-NT in combination with anti-microtubule agents can cause the destruction of both the vascular and avascular compartments of tumors . The two classes of microtubule inhibitors were found to exert markedly different effects . Some agents that inhibited microtubule synthesis , such as HTI-286 and vinorelbine , caused rapid , massive hemorrhagic necrosis when used in combination with C. novyi-NT . In contrast , agents that stabilized microtubules , such as the taxanes docetaxel and MAC-321 , resulted in slow tumor regressions that killed most neoplastic cells . Remaining cells in the poorly perfused regions of tumors could be eradicated by C. novyi-NT . Mechanistic studies showed that the microtubule destabilizers , but not the microtubule stabilizers , radically reduced blood flow to tumors , thereby enlarging the hypoxic niche in which C. novyi-NT spores could germinate . A single intravenous injection of C. novyi-NT plus selected anti-microtubule agents was able to cause regressions of several human tumor xenografts in nude mice in the absence of excessive toxicity . To test this hypothesis , we used spores of Clostridium novyi-NT to treat transplanted tumors in mice . The bacteria were found to markedly improve the efficacy of radiotherapy in several of the mouse models tested . Enhancement was noted with external beam radiation derived from a Cs-137 source , systemic radioimmunotherapy with an I-131-conjugated monoclonal antibody , and a previously undescribed form of experimental brachytherapy using plaques loaded with I-125 seeds . C. novyi-NT spores added little toxicity to the radiotherapeutic regimens , and the combination resulted in long-term remissions in a significant fraction of animals .	However , there was no laboratory or histopathologic evidence of sepsis , and the toxicity could be effectively controlled by simple hydration . In this study , we found that the efficacy of experimental brachytherapy using plaques loaded with C. infarcts . The intravenous injection of C. novyi-NT -LRB- C. -RRB- is a result in experimental tumors . The bacteria were found not toxic in mice in several of the mouse models tested . In the present study , pharmacologic and toxicologic studies were performed to cause regressions of several human tumor xenografts in nude mice in the absence of excessive tumors . C. cells that inhibited microtubule was noted with external beam radiation derived from a Cs-137 source , systemic radioimmunotherapy with an I-131-conjugated monoclonal antibody , and a previously undescribed form of C. brachytherapy using I-125 spores could cause the destruction of both the vascular and avascular compartments of tumors . C. novyi-NT spores added little toxicity -LRB- C. novyi-NT -RRB- , as well as the potential of the efficacy and toxicity of this form of therapy . C. novyi-NT were found to markedly improve the histopathologic toxicity was observed in healthy mice with C. novyi-NT .
46	negative	conflict	1 factor 	Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma -LRB- AITL -RRB- is a systemic disease involving lymph nodes , spleen , and bone marrow . Although the histologic features have been well described , the diagnosis is often challenging , as there are no specific phenotypic or molecular markers available . This study shows that the neoplastic cells of AITL can be identified by aberrant CD10 expression . Archival material from 30 cases of AITL , 10 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified -LRB- PTL -RRB- , and 10 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia were reviewed . Single and double immunostaining for CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD20 , CD21 , CD10 , BCL6 , Ki67 , and LMP-1 in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr early region and polymerase chain reaction -LRB- PCR -RRB- for T-cell receptor gamma chain gene and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene were performed . Three overlapping histologic patterns with hyperplastic follicles , depleted follicles , or without follicles were identified in AITL . Of the 30 cases of AITL , 27 contained CD10 -LRB- + -RRB- T cells . No CD10 -LRB- + -RRB- T cells were present in the cases of PTL or reactive hyperplasia . PCR confirmed a monoclonal or oligoclonal T-cell population in 29 of 30 cases of AITL and a monoclonal B-cell population in 6 cases . Analysis of microdissected CD10 -LRB- + -RRB- single cells showed that they belonged to the neoplastic clone . In conclusion CD10 is a phenotypic marker that specifically identifies the tumor cells in 90 % of AITL , including the early cases . The presence of these cells distinguishes AITL from other PTLs . This finding provides an objective criterion for accurate and early diagnosis of AITL . Various patterns of Epstein-Barr virus -LRB- EBV -RRB- - associated B-cell lymphoproliferation occur in patients with immunodeficiency . We studied 17 cases of T-cell lymphoma displaying extensive EBV-driven B-cell lymphoproliferation or simultaneous/subsequent EBV-associated B-cell lymphoma . In 10 cases of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma , an uncommonly prominent population of EBV + atypical , activated , focally confluent large transformed B cells was found in the background of T-cell lymphoma . In 4 cases , an EBV-associated B-cell neoplasm -LRB- 3 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas , 1 plasmacytoma -RRB- occurred in patients with T-cell lymphoma . Three cases were composite lymphomas of a peripheral T-cell lymphoma , unspecified , combined with EBV-associated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma . The transformed B-cell population displayed EBV latency types 2 and 3 . Monoclonal and oligoclonal B-cell populations were detected in 5 and 6 cases , respectively . Peripheral T-cell lymphomas -LRB- PTCL -RRB- have been generally reported to have a worse prognosis than B-cell lymphomas -LRB- BCL -RRB- . Because of their heterogeneity and scarcity , the outcomes of the different histological subtypes have not been compared . From October 1987 to March 1993 , 1,883 patients with diffuse aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas -LRB- NHL -RRB- included in the LNH87 protocol could be assessed for both morphology and immunophenotyping . Among them , 288 -LRB- 15 % -RRB- had PTCL and 1,595 -LRB- 85 % -RRB- had BCL . According to the Kiel classification , most PTCL were classified as angioimmunoblastic -LRB- AIL ; 23 % -RRB- , pleomorphic medium and large T-cell -LRB- PML ; 49 % -RRB- , or anaplastic large cell -LRB- ALCL ; 20 % -RRB- lymphomas . According to the International Prognostic Index -LRB- IPI -RRB- , PTCL and BCL scores were , respectively : 0 factors , 13 % and 15 % ; 1 factor , 17 % and 22 % ; 2 factors , 24 % and 25 % ; > / = 3 factors , 45 % and 37 % -LRB- P = .09 -RRB- . For BCL and PTCL , respectively , complete remission rates were 63 % and 54 % -LRB- P = .004 -RRB- ; the 5-year overall survival -LRB- OS -RRB- rates were 53 % and 41 % -LRB- P = .0004 -RRB- and event-free survival -LRB- EFS -RRB- rates were 42 % and 33 % -LRB- P < . 0001 -RRB- . Comparison of the different histological subtypes of lymphoma showed that the 5-year OS rate for T-ALCL -LRB- 64 % -RRB- was superior to those of other PTCL -LRB- 35 % -RRB- as well as diffuse large B-cell -LRB- 53 % -RRB- NHL . When multivariate analysis was applied using the IPI score as one factor , nonanaplastic PTCL remained an independent parameter -LRB- P = . 0004 -RRB- . Although the poor prognosis of non-ALCL PTCL could be due in part to the presence of adverse prognostic factors at diagnosis , this study shows that the T-cell phenotype is an independent significant factor , which should be incorporated into the definition of prognostic groups .	Comparison of the different histological subtypes of lymphoma showed that the 5-year OS rate for T-ALCL -LRB- 64 % -RRB- was superior to those of other PTCL -LRB- 35 % -RRB- as well as diffuse large B-cell -LRB- 53 % -RRB- , or anaplastic large cell -LRB- ALCL ; 20 % -RRB- lymphomas . The mean + -RRB- T cells -LRB- P < 0.001 -RRB- , the 5-year overall survival -LRB- P = .004 -RRB- . There was no significant differences between the two groups .

47	negative		 a less costly and less nursing-intensive therapy than 3 days of IV insulin postoperatively 	To describe a novel method of safe and effective intensive management of inpatient hyperglycemia with use of cost-effective protocols directed by a glucose management service -LRB- GMS -RRB- . An intravenous insulin protocol was designed to achieve a glycemic target of 80 to 110 mg/dL . When stable inpatients were transferred from the intravenous protocol to a subcutaneous insulin protocol , which consisted of basal long-acting and prandial and supplemental rapid-acting insulins , the blood glucose target was 80 to 150 mg/dL . Glucose levels were reviewed by the GMS at least daily for protocol adjustments , when necessary . The intravenous insulin protocol was used in 276 patients , and 4,058 capillary blood glucose levels were recorded . Glycemic target levels -LRB- 80 to 110 mg/dL -RRB- were achieved , on average , 10.6 + / - 5.2 hours after initiation of insulin drip therapy . The mean capillary blood glucose level during the study interval was 135.3 + / - 49.9 mg/dL . Hypoglycemia -LRB- < or = 60 mg/dL -RRB- was recorded in 1.5 % of glucose values , and hyperglycemia -LRB- > or = 400 mg/dL -RRB- was recorded in only 0.06 % . The subcutaneous insulin protocol was used in 922 patients , and 18,067 capillary glucose levels were documented . The mean blood glucose level was 145.6 + / - 55.8 mg/dL during the study period . The blood glucose target of 80 to 150 mg/dL was achieved in 58.6 % , whereas 74.3 % of glycemic values were in the clinically acceptable range -LRB- 80 to 180 mg/dL -RRB- . Hypoglycemia -LRB- < or = 60 mg/dL -RRB- occurred in 1.3 % of capillary blood glucose values , and hyperglycemia -LRB- > or = 400 mg/dL -RRB- occurred in 0.4 % of values . Validated protocols dedicated to the achievement of strict glycemic goals were implemented by a GMS and resulted in substantial improvements in glycemic control on the surgical inpatient services , with a reduced frequency of hypoglycemia . The protocols and the GMS have been well received by the inpatient nursing and surgical staff members , and all of this has been done in a cost-effective manner . To determine if glucose management in postcardiothoracic surgery patients with a combined intravenous -LRB- IV -RRB- and subcutaneous -LRB- SC -RRB- insulin regimen reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with diabetes and stress-induced hyperglycemia . Retrospective review of 614 consecutive patients who underwent cardiothoracic -LRB- CT -RRB- surgery in 2005 was performed to evaluate the incidence and treatment of postoperative hyperglycemia and operative morbidity and mortality . Hyperglycemic patients -LRB- glucose > 6.05 mmol/l -RRB- were treated with IV insulin in the intensive care unit -LRB- ICU -RRB- followed by SC insulin -LRB- outside ICU -RRB- . Subgroup analysis was performed on 159 coronary artery bypass grafting -LRB- CABG -RRB- - only patients . Among all CT surgeries , patients with a preoperative diagnosis of diabetes had higher rates of postoperative mortality -LRB- 7.3 vs. 3.3 % ; P = 0.03 -RRB- and pulmonary complications -LRB- 19.5 vs. 11.6 % ; P = 0.02 -RRB- but had similar rates of infections and cardiac , renal , and neurological complications on univariate analysis . However , on multivariate analysis , a preoperative diagnosis of diabetes was not a significant factor in postoperative mortality or pulmonary complications . In CABG-only patients , no significant differences were seen in outcomes between diabetic and nondiabetic patients . Independent of diabetic status , glucose > or = 11 mmol/l on ICU admission was predictive of higher rates of mortality and renal , pulmonary , and cardiac postoperative complications . A combination of IV insulin -LRB- in the ICU -RRB- and SC insulin -LRB- outside the ICU -RRB- , a less costly and less nursing-intensive therapy than 3 days of IV insulin postoperatively , results in a reduction of the increased surgical morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients after CT surgery . We sought to study the optimal management of hyperglycemia in non-intensive care unit patients with type 2 diabetes , as few studies thus far have focused on the subject . We conducted a prospective , multicenter , randomized trial to compare the efficacy and safety of a basal-bolus insulin regimen with that of sliding-scale regular insulin -LRB- SSI -RRB- in patients with type 2 diabetes . A total of 130 insulin-naive patients were randomized to receive glargine and glulisine -LRB- n = 65 -RRB- or a standard SSI protocol -LRB- n = 65 -RRB- . Glargine was given once daily and glulisine before meals at a starting dose of 0.4 units x kg -LRB- -1 -RRB- x day -LRB- -1 -RRB- for blood glucose 140-200 mg/dl or 0.5 units x kg -LRB- -1 -RRB- x day -LRB- -1 -RRB- for blood glucose 201-400 mg/dl . SSI was given four times per day for blood glucose > 140 mg/dl . The mean admission blood glucose was 229 + / - 6 mg/dl and A1C 8.8 + / - 2 % . A blood glucose target of < 140 mg/dl was achieved in 66 % of patients in the glargine and glulisine group and in 38 % of those in the SSI group . The mean daily blood glucose between groups ranged from 23 to 58 mg/dl , with an overall blood glucose difference of 27 mg/dl -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- . Despite increasing insulin doses , 14 % of patients treated with SSI remained with blood glucose > 240 mg/dl . There were no differences in the rate of hypoglycemia or length of hospital stay . Treatment with insulin glargine and glulisine resulted in significant improvement in glycemic control compared with that achieved with the use of SSI alone . Our study indicates that a basal-bolus insulin regimen is preferred over SSI in the management of non-critically ill , hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes . Studies comparing the use of basal bolus with insulin analogs vs. split-mixed regimens with human insulins in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes are lacking . In a controlled multicenter trial , we randomized 130 nonsurgical patients with blood glucose -LRB- BG -RRB- between 140 and 400 mg/dl to receive detemir once daily and aspart before meals -LRB- n = 67 -RRB- or neutral protamine Hagedorn -LRB- NPH -RRB- and regular insulin twice daily -LRB- n = 63 -RRB- . Insulin dose was started at 0.4 U/kg . d for BG between 140 and 200 mg/dl or 0.5 U/kg . d for BG 201-400 mg/dl . Major study outcomes included differences in mean daily BG levels and frequency of hypoglycemic events between treatment groups . A BG target below 140 mg/dl before meals was achieved in 45 % of patients in the detemir/aspart group and 48 % in the NPH/regular group -LRB- P = 0.86 -RRB- . During treatment , 22 patients -LRB- 32.8 % -RRB- in the detemir/aspart group and 16 patients -LRB- 25.4 % -RRB- in the NPH/regular group had at least one episode of hypoglycemia -LRB- BG < 60 mg/dl -RRB- during the hospital stay -LRB- P = 0.34 -RRB- . Treatment with basal/bolus regimen with detemir once daily and aspart before meals results in equivalent glycemic control and no differences in the frequency of hypoglycemia compared to a split-mixed regimen of NPH and regular insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes . We examined the impact of an aspart insulin protocol for treatment of hyperglycemia in the emergency department -LRB- ED -RRB- coupled with rapid initiation of a detemir-aspart insulin protocol for patients admitted to the hospital . ED patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a blood glucose -LRB- BG -RRB- ≥ 200 mg/dL were randomized to intervention -LRB- INT -RRB- or usual care -LRB- UC -RRB- . INT patients -LRB- n = 87 -RRB- received aspart every 2 hours when BG > 200 mg/dL , and if admitted , began daily detemir in the ED . UC patients -LRB- n = 89 -RRB- were treated per hospital physicians . The initial ED BG was 304 ± 76 mg/dL . The final ED BG differed : 217 ± 71 mg/dL for INT patients versus 257 ± 89 mg/dL for UC patients -LRB- P < .01 -RRB- . No INT patients and 3 UC patients had a BG < 50 mg/dL -LRB- P = .5 -RRB- . ED length of stay -LRB- LOS -RRB- was similar : 5.4 ± 1.8 hours for INT patients versus 4.9 ± 1.9 hours for UC patients -LRB- P = .06 -RRB- . Sixty-nine percent from each group were admitted . Admission BG was 184 ± 74 mg/dL for INT patients versus 224 ± 93 mg/dL for UC patients -LRB- P < .01 -RRB- . Patient-day weighted mean glucose was 163 ± 39 mg/dL for INT patients versus 202 ± 39 mg/dL for UC patients -LRB- P < .01 -RRB- . One INT patient and 6 UC patients had a BG < 50 mg/dL -LRB- P = .11 -RRB- . Hospital LOS was similar : 2.7 ± 2.0 versus 3.1 ± 1.9 days , respectively -LRB- P = .58 -RRB- . An aspart insulin protocol safely lowers BG levels in the ED without prolonging LOS . During hospitalization , a detemir-aspart protocol achieves significantly better glycemic control compared with guideline-driven use of NPH-aspart or glargine/detemir-aspart -LRB- usual care -RRB- without increasing hypoglycemia . Standardization of insulin protocols in the ED and hospital settings leads to improvement in overall glycemic control with greater safety and efficacy than usual care . The effect of intensive therapy to achieve tight glycemic control in patients hospitalized in non-critical care settings is unclear . We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effect of intensive glycemic control strategies on the outcomes of death , stroke , myocardial infarction , incidence of infection , and hypoglycemia . We included randomized and observational studies . Bibliographic databases were searched through February 2010 . Random effects model was used to pool results across studies . Nineteen studies -LRB- nine randomized and 10 observational studies -RRB- were included . The risk of bias across studies was moderate . Meta-analysis demonstrates that intensive glycemic control was not associated with significant effect on the risk of death , myocardial infarction , or stroke . There was a trend for increased risk of hypoglycemia -LRB- relative risk , 1.58 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.97-2.57 -RRB- , particularly in surgical studies and when the planned glycemic target was achieved . Intensive glycemic control was associated with decreased risk of infection -LRB- relative risk , 0.41 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.21-0.77 -RRB- that was mainly derived from studies in surgical settings . Intensive control of hyperglycemia in patients hospitalized in non-critical care settings may reduce the risk of infection . The quality of evidence is low and mainly driven by studies in surgical settings . We analyzed 137 episodes of hypoglycemia -LRB- serum glucose less than or equal to 49 mg per deciliter -RRB- occurring in 94 adult patients hospitalized during a six-month period at a tertiary care hospital . Forty-five percent of the patients had diabetes mellitus , and administered insulin was implicated in 90 percent of episodes in diabetics . Hypoglycemia in diabetic patients occurred under a variety of circumstances , frequently because of decreased caloric intake related to illness or hospital routine . Insulin-induced hypoglycemia also occurred during treatment of hyperkalemia -LRB- eight patients -RRB- or during hyperglycemia related to total parenteral nutrition -LRB- six patients -RRB- . Forty-six of the 94 patients had chronic renal insufficiency , and 20 of these 46 had underlying diabetes mellitus . Thus , renal insufficiency unrelated to diabetes mellitus was the second most frequent diagnosis associated with hypoglycemia . The majority of other cases of hypoglycemia were related to liver disease , infections , shock , pregnancy , neoplasia , or burns . Hypoglycemia was not the apparent cause of death in any patient , but the overall hospital mortality was 27 percent and was related to the degree of hypoglycemia and the number of risk factors for hypoglycemia . We conclude that hypoglycemia is a common problem in hospitalized patients , is common in renal insufficiency , is usually iatrogenic , and correlates with high mortality in severely ill patients . Hypoglycemia during hospitalization occurs in patients with and without diabetes . The aims of this study were to determine the incidence , associated risk factors , and short - and long-term outcome of hypoglycemia among hospitalized elderly patients . This is a case-control study conducted at geriatric and medicine departments . All patients 70 years or older with documented hypoglycemia hospitalized within 1 year -LRB- n = 281 -RRB- were compared with a nonhypoglycemic group of 281 elderly , randomly selected patients from the same hospitalized population . Among 5404 patients 70 years or older , 281 -LRB- 5.2 % -RRB- had documented hypoglycemia . Compared with the nonhypoglycemic group , we found the following characteristics to be true in the hypoglycemic group : there were more women than men -LRB- 58 % vs 44 % , P = .001 -RRB- ; sepsis was 10 times more common -LRB- P < .001 -RRB- ; malignancy was 2.8 times more common -LRB- P = .04 -RRB- ; the mean serum albumin level was lower -LRB- 2.8 g/dL vs 3.4 g/dL , P < .001 -RRB- ; and the mean serum creatinine and alkaline phosphatase levels were higher -LRB- P < .001 for both -RRB- . Diabetes was known in 42 % of the hypoglycemic group and in 31 % of the nonhypoglycemic group -LRB- P = .03 -RRB- ; 70 patients in the hypoglycemic group were taking sulfonylureas or insulin . Multivariate logistic analysis showed that sepsis , albumin level , malignancy , sulfonyurea and insulin treatment , alkaline phosphatase level , female sex , and creatinine level were all independent predictors of developing hypoglycemia . Multivariate analysis of mortality found that sepsis , low albumin level , and malignancy were independent predictors , while hypoglycmia was not . Hypoglycemia was common in elderly hospitalized patients and predicted increased in-hospital 3 - and 6-month cumulative mortality . However , in a multivariate analysis , hypoglycemia was not an independent predictor for mortality , implying that it is only a marker . To determine the incidence and manifestations of hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients receiving antihyperglycemic therapy . The study was a 3-month prospective review of consecutive medical records of all adult , nonpregnant hospitalized patients at a 675-bed university hospital who experienced at least 1 blood glucose -LRB- BG -RRB- < or = 60 mg/dL within 48 hours of receiving an antihyperglycemic agent . Of 2174 patients receiving antihyperglycemic agents , 206 -LRB- 9.5 % -RRB- experienced 484 hypoglycemic episodes . Of these episodes , 29 % occurred in patients with type 1 diabetes , 23 % in the ICU , and 72 % in patients receiving only insulin for hyperglycemia . More than 1 episode was experienced by 44 % of the 206 patients . Furthermore , 4 % -LRB- 20 of 484 -RRB- of the hypoglycemic episodes were associated with a hypoglycemia-related adverse event , defined as symptoms , signs , or injury . The mean BG of these episodes was 43.0 mg/dL , significantly lower than the mean BG of 50.9 mg/dL for the 464 episodes without adverse events -LRB- P = .01 -RRB- . One-third of the adverse events occurred with a BG between 50 and 60 mg/dL ; half the adverse events , 10 episodes or 2 % of all hypoglycemic episodes , were serious , involving seizures or an unresponsive patient . A decrease in enteral intake accounted for 40 % of the episodes ; none was attributed to medication error . Less than half the hypoglycemic patients had documented euglycemia within 2 hours . Sulfonylurea agents were associated with higher rates of hypoglycemia than were other oral agents . Hypoglycemia in hospitalized patients taking antihyperglycemic agents is common ; 1 in 25 episodes is associated with an adverse event . Opportunities exist to improve care , particularly around discontinuation of feeding . Hypoglycemia is often cited as a barrier to achieving inpatient glycemic targets . We sought to characterize hypoglycemic events in our institution by work-shift cycle and by specific treatment area . Capillary -LRB- bedside -RRB- and blood -LRB- laboratory -RRB- glucose values of < 70 mg/dl for patients with either a known diagnosis of diabetes or with evidence of hyperglycemia were abstracted from our laboratory database for hospitalizations between October 1 , 2007 , and February 3 , 2008 . Hypoglycemic events were analyzed by 12 h nursing work-shift cycles -LRB- day shift , 07:00 to 18:59 ; night shift , 19:00 to 06:59 -RRB- and by the six medical , surgical , and intensive care areas in the hospital -LRB- designated areas 1 to 6 -RRB- . We identified 206 individual patients with either diabetes or hyperglycemia -LRB- mean age , 67 years ; 56 % men ; 83 % white -RRB- who had 423 hypoglycemic events . There were 78 % more hypoglycemic events during the night shift -LRB- n = 271 events in 128 individual patients -RRB- than during the day shift -LRB- n = 152 events in 96 individual patients -RRB- . Most of the night-shift hypoglycemic measurements were detected between 04:00 and 04:59 or 06:00 and 06:59 . The mean hypoglycemic level was comparable between shifts -LRB- p = .79 -RRB- and across the six inpatient areas . The number of hypoglycemic events per person increased with lengths of hospital stay > 5 days . The prevalence of hypoglycemia varied across patient care areas within the hospital , with most -LRB- 28 % -RRB- detected in one area of the hospital . There are temporal and geographic patterns in the occurrence of hypoglycemia among patients with diabetes or hyperglycemia in our hospital . Further study should focus on the reasons underlying these variations so that specific interventions can address the risk of hypoglycemia during peak times and places . This study set out to determine the incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with chronic kidney disease -LRB- CKD -RRB- , with and without diabetes , and the association of hypoglycemia with mortality . This was a retrospective cohort analysis of 243,222 patients who had 2,040,206 glucose measurements and were cared for at the Veterans Health Administration . CKD was defined as an estimated GFR of < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m -LRB- 2 -RRB- . Hypoglycemia was set at < 70 mg/dl . Mortality was measured 1 day after glucose measurement . The incidence of hypoglycemia was higher in patients with CKD versus without CKD . Among patients with diabetes , the rate was 10.72 versus 5.33 per 100 patient-months and among patients without diabetes was 3.46 versus 2.23 per 100 patient-months , for CKD versus no CKD , respectively . The odds of 1-d mortality were increased at all levels of hypoglycemia but attenuated in CKD versus no CKD . Adjusted odds ratios for 1-d mortality that were associated with glucose values of < 50 , 50 to 59 , and 60 to 69 mg/dl , respectively , versus glucose of > or = 70 mg/dl were 6.09 , 4.10 , and 1.85 for inpatient records from patients with CKD ; 9.95 , 3.79 , and 2.54 for inpatients records from patients without CKD ; 6.84 , 3.28 , and 3.98 for outpatient records from patients with CKD ; and 13.28 , 7.36 , and 4.34 for outpatient records from patients without CKD . CKD is a risk for hypoglycemia , with or without diabetes . The excessive mortality associated with hypoglycemia makes this complication a significant threat to patient safety in CKD . To quantify pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of regular insulin and insulin lispro in type 1 diabetic patients with and without overt diabetic nephropathy . In this double-blind , two-way cross-over , euglycemic -LRB- 5 mmol/l -RRB- glucose clamp study , we investigated the metabolic response to subcutaneous injections of regular insulin and insulin lispro -LRB- 0.2 U/kg -RRB- in 12 type 1 diabetic patients with overt diabetic nephropathy -LRB- proteinuria > 500 mg/24 h and/or serum creatinine > 1.5 mg/dl ; NP group -RRB- and in a control group of 12 type 1 diabetic patients with normal renal function -LRB- DC group -RRB- . Peak plasma free insulin levels with insulin lispro -LRB- 359 -LSB- NP -RSB- vs. 254 pmol/l -LSB- DC -RSB- -RRB- were higher and time to maximal insulin concentrations -LRB- 85 -LSB- NP -RSB- vs. 99 min -LSB- DC -RSB- -RRB- shorter than with regular insulin -LRB- 213 -LSB- NP -RSB- vs. 144 pmol/l -LSB- DC -RSB- ; 118 -LSB- NP -RSB- vs. 153 min -LSB- DC -RSB- -RRB- in both patient groups . Overall insulin levels for regular insulin and for insulin lispro were higher in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy compared with control patients . Time to maximal metabolic effect was shorter with insulin lispro than with regular insulin in both patient groups -LRB- 102 vs. 191 min -LSB- NP -RSB- ; 105 vs. 172 min -LSB- DC -RSB- -RRB- . The overall metabolic effect of regular insulin but not of insulin lispro was lower in patients with diabetic nephropathy than in diabetic control patients -LRB- 967 vs. 1,510 mg/kg , respectively -RRB- . Although insulin levels are higher in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy , the metabolic response to regular insulin is reduced . Insulin lispro maintains its characteristic pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties in patients with overt diabetic nephropathy . In the presence of impaired renal function , patients require less insulin mainly because insulin clearance is prolonged . The aim of this study was to evaluate the insulin requirement related to glomerular filtration rate -LRB- GFR -RRB- in nephropathic Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic patients . In a retrospective study we compared insulin requirement in 20 nephropathic Type 1 diabetic patients and 20 insulin-treated Type 2 diabetic patients from the onset of overt nephropathy until the final stage of renal disease . All patients had proteinuria > 0.5 g/24 h and creatinine clearance > / = 80 ml/min per 1.73 m2 at baseline . Creatinine clearance , urinary protein excretion , glycated haemoglobin and the required insulin doses were determined 3 - to 6-monthly , basal C-peptide was measured at the beginning and the end of the observation period . The required insulin doses were evaluated at creatinine clearance rates of 80 , 60 , 40 , 20 and 10 ml/min per 1.73 m2 -LRB- or at the initiation of dialysis treatment -RRB- . The insulin requirement of patients with Type 1 diabetes was reduced from 0.72 + / - 0.16 IU/kg per day at a creatinine clearance rate of 80 ml/min , to 0.45 + / - 0.13 IU/kg per day at a creatinine clearance rate of 10 ml/min -LRB- decrement of 38 % , P < 0.001 -RRB- . The insulin dose required by Type 2 diabetic patients was reduced from 0.68 + / - 0.28 IU/kg per day at a creatinine clearance rate of 80 ml/min to 0.33 + / - 0.19 IU/kg per day at a clearance rate of 10 ml/min -LRB- decrement 51 % , P < 0.001 -RRB- . The fall in GFR , urinary protein excretion and glycated haemoglobin levels was similar in the two groups . In patients with Type 2 diabetes , C-peptide levels at the beginning and the end of renal function impairment were 2.2 -LRB- 0.4-7.3 -RRB- vs. 2.7 -LRB- 0.1-4.9 -RRB- ng/ml -LRB- NS -RRB- . The reduction in insulin requirement was approximately the same in patients with an initial C-peptide level < 1.0 and in those > / = 1.0 ng/ml -LRB- decrement 57 % vs. 46 % -RRB- . The reduction in insulin requirement in renal insufficiency is similar in Type 1 and insulin-treated Type 2 diabetic patients . In subjects with Type 2 diabetes , the residual insulin secretion has no impact on the reduction in insulin requirement dependent on the GFR .	Retrospective study indicates that a basal-bolus insulin regimen is preferred over SSI in the management of non-critically ill , hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes , as few studies thus far have focused on the subject . The mean blood glucose level was significantly higher in the ICU group -LRB- P < 0.01 -RRB- . There was no differences in the rate of hospital stay . The mean capillary blood glucose difference of 27 to 150 mg/dL , and an overall rates of the increased surgical morbidity and mortality in the surgical inpatient services , with a overall costly and less nursing-intensive therapy than 3 days of IV insulin postoperatively , and neurological complications on the SC of the intensive care -LRB- P = 0.02 -RRB- , but not similar rates of infections -LRB- 95 % confidence interval -LSB- CI -RSB- , 0.96 to 0.99 -RRB- , respectively . Validated protocols dedicated to the achievement of strict glycemic goals were implemented by a GMS and resulted in substantial improvements in glycemic control compared with that achieved with the use of SSI alone . Glycemic target levels -LRB- 80 + / - 5.2 hours after initiation of insulin drip therapy .
48	positive	none			To report 3-year outcomes of patients who participated in a randomized trial evaluating 1-mg and 4-mg doses of preservative-free intravitreal triamcinolone compared with focal/grid photocoagulation for treatment of diabetic macular edema . Eyes with diabetic macular edema and visual acuities of 20/40 to 20/320 were randomly assigned to focal/grid photocoagulation or 1 mg or 4 mg of triamcinolone . At the conclusion of the trial , 3-year follow-up data were available in 306 eyes . Between 2 years -LRB- time of the primary outcome -RRB- and 3 years , more eyes improved than worsened in all 3 treatment groups . Change in visual acuity letter score from baseline to 3 years was +5 in the laser group and 0 in each triamcinolone group . The cumulative probability of cataract surgery by 3 years was 31 % , 46 % , and 83 % in the laser and 1-mg and 4-mg triamcinolone groups , respectively . Intraocular pressure increased by more than 10 mm Hg at any visit in 4 % , 18 % , and 33 % of eyes , respectively . Results in a subset of randomized subjects who completed the 3-year follow-up are consistent with previously published 2-year results and do not indicate a long-term benefit of intravitreal triamcinolone relative to focal/grid photocoagulation in patients with diabetic macular edema similar to those studied in this clinical trial . Most eyes receiving 4 mg of triamcinolone as given in this study are likely to require cataract surgery . clinicaltrials.gov Identifier : NCT00367133 . Prospective , evaluator-masked , controlled , multicenter clinical trial . We included 196 eyes with refractory DME . Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 0.59-mg FA implant -LRB- n = 127 -RRB- or standard of care -LRB- SOC additional laser or observation ; n = 69 -RRB- . The implant was inserted through a pars plana incision . Visits were scheduled on day 2 , weeks 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , and 26 , and thereafter every 13 weeks through 3 years postimplantation . The primary efficacy outcome was ≥ 15-letter improvement in visual acuity -LRB- VA -RRB- at 6 months . Secondary outcomes included resolution of macular retinal thickening and Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Score -LRB- DRSS -RRB- . Safety measures included incidence of adverse events -LRB- AEs -RRB- . The number of implanted eyes with no evidence of retinal thickening at the center of the macula was higher than SOC eyes at 6 months -LRB- P < 0.0001 -RRB- , 1 year -LRB- P < 0.0001 ; 72 % vs 22 % -RRB- , 2 years -LRB- P = 0.016 -RRB- , and 3 years -LRB- P = 0.861 -RRB- . A higher rate of improvement and lower rate of decline in DRSS occurred in the implanted group versus the SOC group at 6 months -LRB- P = 0.0006 -RRB- , 1 year -LRB- P = 0.0016 -RRB- , 2 years -LRB- P = 0.012 -RRB- , and 3 years -LRB- P = 0.0207 -RRB- . Intraocular pressure -LRB- IOP -RRB- ≥ 30 mmHg was recorded in 61.4 % of implanted eyes -LRB- SOC , 5.8 % -RRB- at any time and 33.8 % required surgery for ocular hypertension by 4 years . Of implanted phakic eyes , 91 % -LRB- SOC , 20 % -RRB- had cataract extraction by 4 years . The most common AEs included cataract progression and elevated IOP . The 0.59-mg FA intravitreal implant may be an effective treatment for eyes with persistent or recurrent DME . Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references .	Results in a subset of randomized subjects who completed the 3-year follow-up are consistent with previously published 2-year results and do not indicate a long-term benefit of intravitreal triamcinolone relative to focal/grid photocoagulation in patients with diabetic macular edema similar to those studied in this clinical trial . The primary outcome of ocular hypertension was higher in the laser group -LRB- P < 0.0001 -RRB- , and the SOC group at 6 months -LRB- P = 0.03 -RRB- .

49	positive	none			Accurate patient information can assist clinicians with patient management and in allocating finite resources . However , systems currently in common use have limited predictive value in the clinical setting . The increasing availability of Electronic Health Records -LRB- EHR -RRB- provides an opportunity to use medical information for more accurate patient stability and mortality prediction in the ICU . Develop and evaluate an algorithm which more accurately predicts patient mortality in the ICU , using the correlations between widely available clinical variables from the EHR . We have developed an algorithm , <i> AutoTriage </i> , which uses eight common clinical variables from the EHR to assign patient mortality risk scores . Each clinical variable produces a subscore , and combinations of two or three discretized clinical variables also produce subscores . A combination of weighted subscores produces the overall score . We validated the performance of this algorithm in a retrospective study on the MIMIC III medical ICU dataset . Through the multidimensional analysis of the correlations between eight common clinical variables , <i> AutoTriage </i> provides an improvement in the specificity and sensitivity of patient mortality prediction over existing prediction methods . Several methods have been developed to electronically monitor patients for severe sepsis , but few provide predictive capabilities to enable early intervention ; furthermore , no severe sepsis prediction systems have been previously validated in a randomised study . We tested the use of a machine learning-based severe sepsis prediction system for reductions in average length of stay and in-hospital mortality rate . We conducted a randomised controlled clinical trial at two medical-surgical intensive care units at the University of California , San Francisco Medical Center , evaluating the primary outcome of average length of stay , and secondary outcome of in-hospital mortality rate from December 2016 to February 2017 . Adult patients -LRB- 18 + -RRB- admitted to participating units were eligible for this factorial , open-label study . Enrolled patients were assigned to a trial arm by a random allocation sequence . In the control group , only the current severe sepsis detector was used ; in the experimental group , the machine learning algorithm -LRB- MLA -RRB- was also used . On receiving an alert , the care team evaluated the patient and initiated the severe sepsis bundle , if appropriate . Although participants were randomly assigned to a trial arm , group assignments were automatically revealed for any patients who received MLA alerts . Outcomes from 75 patients in the control and 67 patients in the experimental group were analysed . Average length of stay decreased from 13.0 days in the control to 10.3 days in the experimental group -LRB- p = 0.042 -RRB- . In-hospital mortality decreased by 12.4 percentage points when using the MLA -LRB- p = 0.018 -RRB- , a relative reduction of 58.0 % . No adverse events were reported during this trial . The MLA was associated with improved patient outcomes . This is the first randomised controlled trial of a sepsis surveillance system to demonstrate statistically significant differences in length of stay and in-hospital mortality . NCT03015454 . We validate a machine learning-based sepsis-prediction algorithm -LRB- <i> InSight </i> -RRB- for the detection and prediction of three sepsis-related gold standards , using only six vital signs . We evaluate robustness to missing data , customisation to site-specific data using transfer learning and generalisability to new settings . A machine-learning algorithm with gradient tree boosting . Features for prediction were created from combinations of six vital sign measurements and their changes over time .

For detection of sepsis and severe sepsis , <i> InSight </i> achieves an AUROC curve of 0.92 -LRB- 95 % CI 0.90 to 0.93 -RRB- and 0.87 -LRB- 95 % CI 0.86 to 0.88 -RRB- , respectively . Four hours before onset , <i> InSight </i> predicts septic shock with an AUROC of 0.96 -LRB- 95 % CI 0.94 to 0.98 -RRB- and severe sepsis with an AUROC of 0.85 -LRB- 95 % CI 0.79 to 0.91 -RRB- . <i> InSight </i> outperforms existing sepsis scoring systems in identifying and predicting sepsis , severe sepsis and septic shock . This is the first sepsis screening system to exceed an AUROC of 0.90 using only vital sign inputs . <i> InSight </i> is robust to missing data , can be customised to novel hospital data using a small fraction of site data and retains strong discrimination across all institutions .

50	positive	none			The secretory tissue of the eye , the ciliary processes , contains an enzyme receptor complex , composed of membrane proteins , the catalytic moiety of the enzyme adenylate cyclase , a guanyl nucleotide regulatory protein -LRB- or N protein -RRB- , and other features . The enzyme can be activated by well-known neurohumoral or humoral agents , catecholamines , glycoprotein hormones produced by the hypothalamic pituitary axis , and other related compounds , including placental gonadotropin , organic fluorides , and forskolin , a diterpene . These compounds cause the ciliary epithelia to produce cyclic AMP at an accelerated rate . Cyclic AMP , as a second messenger , causes , either directly or indirectly , a decrease in the net rate of aqueous humor inflow that may be modulated by cofactors . Clinical syndromes fit the experimental data so that an integrated explanation can be given for the reduced intraocular pressure witnessed under certain central nervous system and adrenergic influences . The molecular biology of this concept provides important leads for future investigations that bear directly both upon the regulation of intraocular pressure and upon glaucoma . Topical ocular application of forskolin , a diterpene that increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate by stimulating adenylate cyclase directly without cell surface mediation , lowered intraocular pressure -LRB- IOP -RRB- in rabbits , monkeys , and volunteers who were free from eye disease . In man 50 microliters of a topical suspension of 1 % forskolin significantly lowered IOP in 1 h , the effect reaching a peak at 2 h but remaining significant for at least 5 h. Outflow pressure fell by 70 % on average .

The week prior to drug therapy , baseline IOP measurements were carried out at hourly intervals from 9:30 am to 3:30 pm on three days . Each drug was applied topically to both eyes of each monkey twice daily for at least four days . The IOP was measured with a calibrated pneumatonometer at the same hourly intervals on treatment days as on the baseline days . The IOP at each time of day on treatment days was compared with the average baseline IOP measured at the corresponding time of day . Topical application of timolol , epinephrine , pilocarpine , vanadate , and prostaglandin F2 alpha significantly reduced IOP without evidence of tolerance or tachyphylaxis during the course of therapy . Forskolin did not significantly decrease IOP after the second day of treatment .
